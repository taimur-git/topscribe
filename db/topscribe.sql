(2, 1, 'Narrative Essay', 'A narrative uses tools such as flashbacks, flash-forwards, and transitions that often build to a climax. The focus of a narrative is the plot. When creating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their audience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the narrative. A narrative is usually arranged chronologically.'),
(3, 1, 'Argumentative Essay', 'An argumentative essay is a critical piece of writing, aimed at presenting objective analysis of the subject matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The main idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of positive or negative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and analysis, strong internal logic and sharp structure.'),
(4, 2, 'Review', 'Reviews are part fact based and part opinion and they are there to review certain subjects. Review articles work hard to accomplish two things: first, they accurately and thoroughly identify and describe the subject that is being reviewed; and second, they use experience and research to provide an informed and intelligent opinion of that subject. Review articles present a constructive and critical analysis of existing literature, accomplished through analysis, comparison, and summary. They can identify specific problems or gaps and can even provide recommendations for research in the future.'),
(5, 2, 'Satire', 'Satire is meant to be humourous, and is a type of parody presented in a format typical of mainstream journalism, and called a satire because of its content. News satire relies heavily on irony and deadpan humor. '),
(6, 2, 'Opinion Piece', 'Opinion pieces consist only of the author’s viewpoint on a particular study’s interpretation, methods, or analysis. The author can comment on the strengths and weaknesses of a certain hypothesis or theory, and the articles are usually both backed by sound evidence and based on constructive criticism.'),
(7, 2, 'Lifestyle', 'Although the topics can vary greatly, lifestyle articles focus on issues related to one’s lifestyle. This can include everything from recreation to health and relationships to real-life interviews, and they can even include statistics if you like.'),
(8, 2, 'News', 'News articles have to be written without bias or personal interpretations by the reporters themselves. It provides just enough information so that the reader or viewer learns what happened from the storyline and nothing else. News articles are there to relay events, basic information, and facts in an accurate, unbiased, and straightforward way.'),
(9, 2, 'Interview', 'The interviewer asks questions, then writes down the answers that are received, so it isn’t an opinion piece, but instead centers on facts. Interviews have introductory or lead paragraphs, but the bulk of the article consists of the questions and answers discussed at the interview.'),
(10, 3, 'Sonnet', '     3 quatrains (4 lines each) and a couplet (2 lines)     Couplet usually forms a conclusion     Rhyme scheme: ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'),

(12, 3, 'Elegy', 'The elegy is a type of poem that lacks particular rules, but it usually is written in mourning following a death. They can be written for a particular person, or treat the subject of loss more generally.'),

(14, 3, 'Limerick', 'Limericks are humorous poems that have a more distinct rhythm. Their subject matter is sometimes crude, but always designed to offer laughs.'),
(15, 3, 'Free Verse', 'There are no rules, and writers can do whatever they choose: to rhyme or not, to establish any rhythm.'),
(16, 3, 'Haiku', '3 lines, Line 1 contains 5 syllables, Line 2 contains 7 syllables, Line 3 contains 5 syllables'),
(17, 3, 'Ballad', 'Ballads usually take a narrative form to tell us stories. They are often arranged in quatrains, but the form is loose enough that writers can easily modify it.'),
(18, 2, 'Blog', 'A sort of informal diary-style text entry. Write to your hearts content.'),
(19, 1, 'Descriptive Essay', 'Descriptive writing is characterized by sensory details, which appeal to the physical senses, and details that appeal to a reader\'s emotional, physical, or intellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the audience, creating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the description are the rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A description is usually arranged spatially but can also be chronological or emphatic.');

(5, 'An Appeal to the Senses: The Development of the Braille System in Nineteenth-Century France', ' The invention of Braille was a major turning point in the history of disability. The writing system of raised dots used by visually impaired people was developed by Louis Braille in nineteenth-century France. In a society that did not value disabled people in general, blindness was particularly stigmatized, and lack of access to reading and writing was a significant barrier to social participation. The idea of tactile reading was not entirely new, but existing methods based on sighted systems were difficult to learn and use. As the first writing system designed for blind people’s needs, Braille was a groundbreaking new accessibility tool. It not only provided practical benefits, but also helped change the cultural status of blindness. This essay begins by discussing the situation of blind people in nineteenth-century Europe. It then describes the invention of Braille and the gradual process of its acceptance within blind education. Subsequently, it explores the wide-ranging effects of this invention on blind people’s social and cultural lives.\r\n\r\nLack of access to reading and writing put blind people at a serious disadvantage in nineteenth-century society. Text was one of the primary methods through which people engaged with culture, communicated with others, and accessed information; without a well-developed reading system that did not rely on sight, blind people were excluded from social participation (Weygand, 2009). While disabled people in general suffered from discrimination, blindness was widely viewed as the worst disability, and it was commonly believed that blind people were incapable of pursuing a profession or improving themselves through culture (Weygand, 2009). This demonstrates the importance of reading and writing to social status at the time: without access to text, it was considered impossible to fully participate in society. Blind people were excluded from the sighted world, but also entirely dependent on sighted people for information and education.\r\n\r\nIn France, debates about how to deal with disability led to the adoption of different strategies over time. While people with temporary difficulties were able to access public welfare, the most common response to people with long-term disabilities, such as hearing or vision loss, was to group them together in institutions (Tombs, 1996). At first, a joint institute for the blind and deaf was created, and although the partnership was motivated more by financial considerations than by the well-being of the residents, the institute aimed to help people develop skills valuable to society (Weygand, 2009). Eventually blind institutions were separated from deaf institutions, and the focus shifted towards education of the blind, as was the case for the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, which Louis Braille attended (Jimenez et al, 2009). The growing acknowledgement of the uniqueness of different disabilities led to more targeted education strategies, fostering an environment in which the benefits of a specifically blind education could be more widely recognized.\r\n\r\nSeveral different systems of tactile reading can be seen as forerunners to the method Louis Braille developed, but these systems were all developed based on the sighted system. The Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris taught the students to read embossed roman letters, a method created by the school’s founder, Valentin Hauy (Jimenez et al., 2009). Reading this way proved to be a rather arduous task, as the letters were difficult to distinguish by touch. The embossed letter method was based on the reading system of sighted people, with minimal adaptation for those with vision loss. As a result, this method did not gain significant success among blind students.\r\n\r\nLouis Braille was bound to be influenced by his school’s founder, but the most influential pre-Braille tactile reading system was Charles Barbier’s night writing. A soldier in Napoleon’s army, Barbier developed a system in 1819 that used 12 dots with a five line musical staff (Kersten, 1997). His intention was to develop a system that would allow the military to communicate at night without the need for light (Herron, 2009). The code developed by Barbier was phonetic (Jimenez et al., 2009); in other words, the code was designed for sighted people and was based on the sounds of words, not on an actual alphabet. Barbier discovered that variants of raised dots within a square were the easiest method of reading by touch (Jimenez et al., 2009). This system proved effective for the transmission of short messages between military personnel, but the symbols were too large for the fingertip, greatly reducing the speed at which a message could be read (Herron, 2009). For this reason, it was unsuitable for daily use and was not widely adopted in the blind community.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Barbier’s military dot system was more efficient than Hauy’s embossed letters, and it provided the framework within which Louis Braille developed his method. Barbier’s system, with its dashes and dots, could form over 4000 combinations (Jimenez et al., 2009). Compared to the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, this was an absurdly high number. Braille kept the raised dot form, but developed a more manageable system that would reflect the sighted alphabet. He replaced Barbier’s dashes and dots with just six dots in a rectangular configuration (Jimenez et al., 2009). The result was that the blind population in France had a tactile reading system using dots (like Barbier’s) that was based on the structure of the sighted alphabet (like Hauy’s); crucially, this system was the first developed specifically for the purposes of the blind.\r\n\r\nWhile the Braille system gained immediate popularity with the blind students at the Institute in Paris, it had to gain acceptance among the sighted before its adoption throughout France. This support was necessary because sighted teachers and leaders had ultimate control over the propagation of Braille resources. Many of the teachers at the Royal Institute for Blind Youth resisted learning Braille’s system because they found the tactile method of reading difficult to learn (Bullock & Galst, 2009). This resistance was symptomatic of the prevalent attitude that the blind population had to adapt to the sighted world rather than develop their own tools and methods. Over time, however, with the increasing impetus to make social contribution possible for all, teachers began to appreciate the usefulness of Braille’s system (Bullock & Galst, 2009), realizing that access to reading could help improve the productivity and integration of people with vision loss. It took approximately 30 years, but the French government eventually approved the Braille system, and it was established throughout the country (Bullock & Galst, 2009).\r\n\r\nAlthough Blind people remained marginalized throughout the nineteenth century, the Braille system granted them growing opportunities for social participation. Most obviously, Braille allowed people with vision loss to read the same alphabet used by sighted people (Bullock & Galst, 2009), allowing them to participate in certain cultural experiences previously unavailable to them. Written works, such as books and poetry, had previously been inaccessible to the blind population without the aid of a reader, limiting their autonomy. As books began to be distributed in Braille, this barrier was reduced, enabling people with vision loss to access information autonomously. The closing of the gap between the abilities of blind and the sighted contributed to a gradual shift in blind people’s status, lessening the cultural perception of the blind as essentially different and facilitating greater social integration.\r\n\r\nThe Braille system also had important cultural effects beyond the sphere of written culture. Its invention later led to the development of a music notation system for the blind, although Louis Braille did not develop this system himself (Jimenez, et al., 2009). This development helped remove a cultural obstacle that had been introduced by the popularization of written musical notation in the early 1500s. While music had previously been an arena in which the blind could participate on equal footing, the transition from memory-based performance to notation-based performance meant that blind musicians were no longer able to compete with sighted musicians (Kersten, 1997). As a result, a tactile musical notation system became necessary for professional equality between blind and sighted musicians (Kersten, 1997).\r\n\r\nBraille paved the way for dramatic cultural changes in the way blind people were treated and the opportunities available to them. Louis Braille’s innovation was to reimagine existing reading systems from a blind perspective, and the success of this invention required sighted teachers to adapt to their students’ reality instead of the other way around. In this sense, Braille helped drive broader social changes in the status of blindness. New accessibility tools provide practical advantages to those who need them, but they can also change the perspectives and attitudes of those who do not.', 1, '2023-02-27 08:13:37', 0, 18, 84),
(6, 'How to stop Cyber bullying', 'The use of information technology is currently a more popular social phenomenon than ever before. Thus, most young people are using the Internet for different purposes which may include studies and undertaking research, but mostly for socialization (Ybarra 247). The internet has now become a big source of fun for the majority of young people, with chatting, e-mailing, sharing pictures, videos and other forms of documents and files becoming everyday activities. Nevertheless, just like in many other social situations in life, there are people who take pride in harassing, demeaning and bullying others using the information technology and electronic devices, a practice commonly referred to as cyber bullying (“Prevent Cyber bullying”). Bullying can cause frustrations on the victims, especially those who are bullied constantly, resulting in psychological trauma or even more fatal occurrences such as suicide. Thus, parents should team up with their children to explore and develop safe ways of using technology, while monitoring and controlling their children’s internet use, to protect their children against cyber bullying.\r\nThe practice of receiving mean messages, threatening texts, hurtful posts or even negative and damaging rumors is something that is happening with teens and adolescents every single day globally. It is no longer unusual for teens to find sexually explicit and obscene photographs of them or their friends on the internet, even without knowing how pictures ended up there. According to bullyingstatistics.org, 50 of adolescents and teens have experienced cyber bullying, and equally 50 of the teens and adolescents have been involved in cyber bullying (bullyingstatistics.org). Additionally, one in every three adolescents has received threatening messages either through the Internet or over the phone, while 25 of teens have experienced repetitive cyber bullying (bullyingstatistics.org). Consequently, according to statistics from the meganmeierfoundation.org, 2.2 million school children reported having experienced cyber bullying in the USA in 2011 (“Bullying, Cyber bullying & Suicide Statistics”). Most worrying though, is the fact that 38 of frequent bullied-victims in 2013 reported having suicidal thoughts, which sends a shock down the spine, considering that suicide has been identified as the third major cause of death for young people aged between 15 and 24 years (“Bullying, Cyber bullying & Suicide Statistics”).\r\nWhile the connection between cyber bullying and suicidal thoughts for 38 of the people who have been bullied repetitively can seem to be farfetched, there is no doubt that evidence lies everywhere that cyber bullying is a killer behavior. Alexis Pilkington, a well known and celebrated athlete at her prime age of career committed suicide in her bedroom, following a streak of cyber bullying messages, thus ending her promising life on March 21, 2010 (Long and Gross, n.p.). Why is cyber bulling such a big issue if one may ask? Cyber bullying has the same effects as physical bullying; only that cyber bullying is worse, since there is no running away (Ybarra, 251). It would be easier to escape from physical confrontation, but the psychological trauma arising from cyber bullying is devastating. This is because; the internet is all over, and if an individual being cyber-bullied decided not to access the internet anymore, his/her friends or alternatively enemies, will still make the torture continue. Simply put therefore, cyber bullying can frustrate a victim to death, since there are just very few options of running away from it once it has started (Ybarra, 251). The major problem is that the victim may at times turn out to be the aggressor in an attempt to defend against the cyber bullies, and this can go on until cows come home. However, one thing is certain; psychological trauma, mental illnesses or at worst suicidal thoughts, are not farfetched occurrences on cyber bullying victims.\r\nThere is no doubt therefore, that many organizations, both online and on-location have come up to help address the vice of cyber bullying. In every major city or town, every social media site and every community organization running out there, someone is doing something about cyber bullying. Campaigns have been launched on the online platforms and even in the mainstream media through print messages warning against the evil of cyber bullying, while others are advertising professional help for the victims of cyber bullying. The setback associated with online and on-location campaigns against cyber bullying is that they target helping the victims of cyber bullying, and not so much on preventing potential victims from falling into the trap (bullyingstatistics.org). The government on its side is enacting, defining and redefining laws and statutes that can prosecute the perpetrators of cyber bullying once they have been unlucky to be nabbed by the hand of the law. Nevertheless, even with appropriate laws in place, with the anonymity option that cyber bullies mostly apply, finding them into the drag net is something that resilience will reward. Simply put therefore, the society is trying the most viable options at hand, but the options never prove to be adequate for the daunting task of bringing down cyber bullying (Long and Gross, n.p.).\r\nTherefore, the best and only solution to cyber bullying is this one; child-parent partnership to exploring and adapting safe ways of using the internet. Culture builds people or people build culture. Either way, culture has an influence on the way of life of a people. Thus, building the culture of responsible use of the internet and the social media platforms is the most fool proof method of addressing cyber bullying (“Prevent Cyber bullying”.). However, building such a culture cannot be that simple. The internet has temptations. But, even with the temptations, a prepared and warned teen or adolescent is better in handling the temptation than the unprepared and the clueless one. In this respect, parents can build a culture of responsible internet use through partnering with their children, not in prohibiting them from the social media and internet use, but letting them understand fully the magnitude of the danger posed by irresponsible use of the internet and the other technology tools available to them (“Prevent Cyber bullying”).\r\nParents can sit down and discuss with their children about the internet and its applications. Parents should know what their children are doing online by carefully monitoring every of their online interaction whenever possible. Through the child-parent partnership, parents should set the rule of internet and other technology tools used by their children (“Prevent Cyber bullying”). With the knowledge of how the children are using the internet and the rules of its use in place, parents should enforce the rules with a firm hand, but encourage and reward responsible use with an equally open and embracing hand. Parents should become indirect partners to what their children do online. Monitor whatever they do through secretly installed monitoring and control software (“Prevent Cyber bullying”). Parents should borrow and use their children’s devices for simple and routine surveillance. Parent can recommend a responsible adult to follow their children on their social media websites and pages, and simply evaluate their activities. Parents should make their children’s social media and internets use their job to monitor and control.\r\nThere are still chances that critics will counter this solution by holding that parents cannot stalk their children forever, while also holding that it is unethical to stalk their children’s internet and social media interactions anyway. The position for this argument however, is that monitoring and control can continue until the age of responsibility is attained, where it may become tricky for parents to continue monitoring and controlling their children. However, by then, their children will have developed a culture of caution, if not that of desisting from potentially harmful internet and social media interactions (Ybarra, 255). This way, a win-win situation will have been created by averting the chances of cyber bullies attacking such children, while also protecting against such children turning out to be cyber-bullies. If every parent would do that, then, only the runaway dissidents would be conducting the cyber bullying business, and even then, they would be fewer for the hand of law to target effectively.', 2, '2023-02-27 08:14:49', 0, 6, 13),
(7, 'What Rights Should Animals Have?', 'Animal rights as noted by Buzzle (2012) are also called animal liberation. It is a concept to ensure that animal rights are protected as equally as those of human beings. These rights are there to ensure that human beings do not harm, exploit, abuse or kill animals aimlessly. In this concept, it is illegal to use animals in any way that makes them feel pain, suffer or even die. It tries to explain to human beings that it is not a right practice to violate these rights. The concept was started in 1975 by Peter Singer in a book entitled animal liberation. It came to being after the birth of American Society for the prevention of cruelty of animals.\r\n\r\nAnimal rights have been enforced in several parts of the world today. For instance, in Germany, it was voted and included in the constitution that was in the parliament’s house. The vote was aimed at adding a simple clause in the constitution to change the way in which people treated animals in that country. It is the first country in Europe to accept constitutionally the fact that animals had some rights like fair treatment and good feeding. The same has been followed in several other continents in the world and have led to a fairer treatment of all animals with a court penalty owing to the violation thereof as discussed by CNN (2012).\r\n\r\nAccording to Lafollette (n.d), there are boundaries about animals that human beings should strive not to cross as opposed to treating animals in the way one pleases. It is not legitimate to mistreat animals even though they have no voice to rise. In this culture that we are living in today, animals are used as a main source of food, clothes, and research on drugs and to test the vulnerability of some appliances at home. All these can only be realized when the animal is dead or involves inflicting pain to the animal. Animals have a right against overcrowding. This implies that an animal has a right to enough space during its lifespan. This has not been followed especially by farmers who keep them for profit. Animals also have rights to enough movement. Due to the limitations of space, animals are confided in one place leading to less feeding and poor movement. For instance, chicken are overcrowded in little battery cages. The more crowded the animals are, the more likely they are to attack each other and cause injury to one another.\r\n\r\nIn an opinion, Lafollette (n. d) adds that people should use more of vegetables to reduce the killing of animals for food. Many people hold an opinion that animals do not feel pain and has led to the killing of many animals for not only food but also for scientific research and testing. When a dog is hit by a stray vehicle, the way it convulses, bleeds, and yelps is a sure proof that animals feel pain. The same way, a cat reacts even at the small attempt to step on its tail is another proof of sensitivity of their nervous system. It becomes controversial at times because there is need for nutrients in humans that can only be found in animals and the experiments that are done on animals is vital for human survival.\r\n\r\nAs noted by Lin (2012), there are some myths that people hold about animal rights activists. One of these myths is that activist are more fond of animals than human beings. This is not the case anyway. Caring about animals does not render them more important than human beings. This is the reason as to why most animal activists are involved in humanitarian rights like hunger, poverty, sweatshops, feminism and other civil rights. Another myth is about leather materials compared to fur clothes and shoes. This is because fur can be obtained without necessarily killing the animal, but to get leather the animal has to be killed to get the skin of that animal.\r\n\r\nAccording to Buzzle (2012), animal rights activists are faced with the headache of controlling the rate at which animals are killed or injured. They have worked to make known their reputation just like politicians and celebrities. They have worked to stop some meat companies against the overexploitation of animals through slaughtering and butcher business. Animal rights is just a concept, it is known to many people but the movement, well known as animal rights movement has not yet been enforced to maximum. On the other hand, there are many benefits that animals give to human beings.\r\n\r\nLin (2012) notes that there are issues and controversies that have come about owing to the enforcement of these animal rights as a law; some of these include human overpopulation. It is a threat to the peaceful existence of both wild and domestic animals; when people on the planet increase in number, it leads to the decrease in the space that animals are allowed to live in. In developing countries, where the population grows by day, animal health has declined due to poor feeding and little growing space. Animals have always been termed as property of the human being. This has left the human being with an allegation that they have the right to use or even abuse these animals as long as they are their property. Animals have been killed for the benefit of the human being, regardless of how trivial the case might become.\r\n\r\nAnother issue according to Lin (2012) is that of veganism and diet. This is the fight against the use of animal products ranging from meat and wool, to silk and milk. Factory farming falls under the same category as it involves a lot of cruelty to animals. The fact that human beings use animals for food and other diet related products is a violation of animal rights. Some religions hold animals with great honor and has led to such animals being protected against use, misuse and killing. Overfishing in most of the sources has led to a great deal of threat to aquatic life. When the fish is taken away from water, it certainly dies after a very short period of time, during which it goes through immense pains. Countries that are worst hit by drought have even fallen short of this important dietary component. Vivisection is a concept in the science of animal experimentation. These acts violate animal rights especially when the animal has to be killed to extract the test materials.\r\n\r\nMost people in developed countries and a few in the developing countries keep animals as pets. Examples are the cats and the dogs. These animals are brutally killed by their owners in their shelters or just at home. Those who do not end up being killed are denied the right to proper feeding and hygiene. They are not sprayed regularly neither are their shelters cleaned. Hunting is an activity that has raised conflicts between activists and hunters. It is illegal to kill any animal for meat, regardless of where the killing is done. Fur materials, especially clothes, are warm and fashionable. The problem is the suffering that the animal goes through in the process of obtaining this fur.\r\n\r\nHickle (2011) seconds the allegation that animals have rights and many people have objected to this allegation. This explains the reasons as to why animals are still suffering in the hands of human beings. There is the strong belief that rights only include those to vote, to speech, to democracy and to worship. Questions have propped up about what importance these rights have to animals. It has been forgotten that animals have a right to life and to protection against any form of pain. When a cat kills rats in a store, it is not taken by humans that the cat violated the rights of the rat by killing it. These are rodents who could bring great harm to human food as well as cause illnesses in people, not counting the losses in wasted property. In the same view point, when a dog bites a kid, that is harming a human being and it is not a violation of the dog’s right if it is killed to stop any further harm to someone else.\r\n\r\nFeinberg (n.d) puts an argument in the opposite direction by noting that animals should have no rights because they cannot reason, have no direct duties and are not responsible creatures. It is pointless arguing with an animal because of its lack of reasoning that is naturally in animals. In the same way, you cannot give instructions or directions to an animal unless it has been trained thoroughly to respond to some sign language or some human sounds. An animal cannot adapt to any environment or situation therefore has no right. Since even when rights towards an animal are violated by a human being, the animal is not in a position to file any case on its own hence there is no need for the rights in the first place.\r\n', 4, '2023-02-27 08:16:03', 0, 6, 8),
(8, 'Police Brutality', 'Police are law enforcers of the nation, mandated with authority to manage community peace and security. As enforcers of laws, they underwent substantive education on security management and crime prevention strategies. Laid with high expectations from constituents, they are expected to perform their roles and mandates professionally and in observance to international humanitarian standards. However, empirical evidences showed otherwise as emerging abuses and police brutality are mounted by civilian communities.\r\n\r\nThis essay will explicate police brutality in United States and delve into records of frequency, severity and ramification of police brutality exacted against civilians.\r\n\r\n# Brutality\r\n\r\nPolice brutality is one of those alarming human rights violations done by person of authorities against civilians who are possible suspects or those already serving their sentences as adjudged criminals. Roberts (2011) pointed that in youtube alone, an e-site containing video records, produced about 497,000 results when “police brutality” is subjected into the search engine. Roberts (2011) described that these videos either depict beaten women, kids and the aged or violent and bloody exaction of testimonies from unwilling suspects. Some testimonies of victims who were able to undergo sad ordeal revealed electrocution; suffocation, psychological torment or threat; emotional shocks; direct physical assault, and the like done by police with psychopatic and sociopath tendencies. Skolnick and Fyfe (1993) explicated that police brutality brought along with it such dehumanizing intent by treating the target with such concealed venality and such degrading impact of violent torture.\r\n\r\nRoberts (2011) attributed this inhuman way of managing suspects, civilians and victims to militarist treatment as abuse of power. Those who are involved in police brutality tactics are characterized with such nastiness as they were trained to view the public, the people whom they ought to secure, as their enemy. To some extent, some police officers have made policing activity leveled beyond preservation of order into cyclical patterns of injustice as commission of human rights. Often logged without witnesses to corroborate the conduct of brutalities, Bandes (1999) noted that authorities would just label this as an incident which is either isolated, systemic, or part of a larger pattern to suppress a movement. Bandes (1999) explicated that police brutality are often portrayed by court as something anecdotal, fragmented and isolated from institutional pattern (p. 1275) reinforced by causes that could be political, social, psychological and cultural (Bandes, 1999, p. 2). Experts opined that victims of police brutality would have difficulty expressing such unfair victimization because complaints about it are discouraged due to dearth of evidences, lack of corroborative testimonies, records are expunged, and police records are purposively made inaccessible. Victims are also doubly confronted with difficulty in baring experiences out of restrictive evidentiary rulings, of judicial insensitivity to police perjury, of the law of omerta or total silence, of assailant’s immunity from punitive actions (Bandes, 1999, p. 7). Thus, there is perceived failure to correct endemic system of police lawlessness and adherence to violence, often directed to powerless and marginalized members of specific communities.\r\n\r\nPolice brutality is not simply a violent act. More often, these are kinds of security managers who are in collaboration with groups and decision-makers who lacked respect to procedures that are legally provided. The prevalence of these cases on police brutality simply depict the need to address the problem not only at the institutional level but must be comprehensively rectified by in-depth investigation; of brutality cases demystification, and strict enforcement of the administrative laws to hasten the professionalization of police forces. Empirical studies based on selected cases further showed that police brutalities aren’t investigated with expediency or effectiveness, and unless the case is focused with media mileage, no administrative actions are instituted by executive authorities.\r\n\r\n# King Case\r\n\r\nThe case of Rodney Glen King is a classic and most prominent example of police brutality. King, a divorcee with kids, was violently harmed and beaten by police enforcers of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) sometime in 1991 after he was caught by authorities robbing a store and have gravely threatened and lambasted the storeowner with an iron bar (Cannon, 1999). King was beaten by police badly and such incident was captured by media workers who magnified it to public eyes, and subsequently caused dissension amongst black community—people who have viewed the incident as glaring proof of racial prejudice and discrimination (Cannon, 1999). Police were subjected in a court trial but whose acquittal resulted to riots at LA in 1992. Civil suits were later charged against the enforcers which jailed two officers while two others were acquitted (Cannon, 1999).\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent case, King and his two other companies were arrested by police officers due to over speeding at a highway and driving his car with alcohol’s influence (Cannon, 1999). Albeit police warning, King ignored them. He also made some resistance while authorities were about to handcuff him. Police used taser to subdue him but was later prompted to beat him with56 batons blows which caused him 11 skull fractures and brain damage, broken joints, bones and teeth. Medical test further proved that King was using marijuana. He was likewise severely ridiculed by enforcers while at such state (Cannon, 1999).\r\n\r\nOut of this incident, LA lawyers sued the police officers for excessive use of violent force to King and of administrative negligence due to his inability of the supervisor to order the stoppage of further assaults to King (Cannon, 1999). The trial orbited with procedural sensitivities until the jury of Ventura Country decided for the acquittal of accused policemen (Cannon, 1999). The decision was however unacceptable for US president and other executives citing that King is a victim of police brutality (Cannon, 1999). The impact of such decision and resulted to violence rooted by blackmen-sponsored riots in LA which killed a number of persons, wounded thousands, damaged the national economy and incurred financial losses (Cannon, 1999).\r\n\r\nAfter he recovered, King appealed for peace on television and the Department of Justice of United States revived the investigation. The case resulted to the imprisonment of Laurence Powell and Sergeant Satcey Koon (Cannon, 1999). Wind and Briseno were acquitted. King was indemnified with $3.8 million from said civil suit (Cannon, 1999).\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe case of King did not end there. It happened with many others. Indeed, the cited cases remind government authorities to further improve and professionalize policemen of their duties in managing peace and order. On the other hand, there is also a need for civilian populace to exercise their rights with sobriety, to be lawful and to act with propriety. People ought to realize that peace and order, isn’t the sole responsibility of police authorities. It is likewise the role of the civilian community to maintain community peace, although they must also reassert their constitutional rights in case they become object of police brutality and other relate or form of human rights violations. Meanwhile, stakeholders of peace and justice should maintain their vigilance to uphold human rights at all times and to act with moral uprightness.', 3, '2023-02-27 08:17:01', 0, 19, 15),
(9, 'Overpopulation as a Global Environmental Crisis: Concept and Prevention', 'Overpopulation is defined “a country or region that has too many people and is therefore not capable of achieving or maintaining a suitable standard of living” (Pitzl 168). This implies that overpopulation is just about a geographical area that has too many people and limited resources to take care of the numbers of people within it. Another definition of overpopulation is that it is “the condition of having a population as dense as to cause environmental deterioration and impaired quality of life or a population crash” (Gonzalez 117).\r\n\r\nThese two definitions of overpopulation seem to have some differences as well as some commonalities. First of all, both definitions are based on the fact that overpopulation is based on the fact that there might be too many people as opposed to resources in a given area. This implies that overpopulation occurs when there are more people in relation to the resources available to them for their survival and livelihoods.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the two writers are not in agreement about the scope of globalization. Whilst Pitzl defines globalization in terms of countries or geographical regions, Gonzalez views it as a global matter which has an impact on the natural environment. This means that the first definition localizes the idea of overpopulation whilst the second generation looks at it as a global problem or issue.\r\n\r\n# Reasons why Overpopulation is a Global Issue\r\n\r\nIn this world, resources and the natural environment are shared. Instead of having a limited access to natural resources, most resources in the natural environment transcend natural borders. Hence, it can be argued that if there is excessive pressure on the natural resources of a given nation, it would affect users of other nations and make it a global matter or issue.\r\n\r\nExamining overpopulation critically, it is conclusive that it leads to major problems which are a a direct consequence of having too many people using the same natural resources. This often results in pressure over natural resources, pollution, congestion, unorganized development amongst others.\r\n\r\nNagel and Guinness identify that overpopulation can be defined in terms of having a population that is above the normal level that a nation or community can hold (111). The standard level of population that a community’s resources can support is known as the optimum population (Nagel and Guinness 111). However, when the population goes above the optimum population, there is an increasing pressure on resources and the living standards of the community would begin to decline. Hence, there would be the non-sustainable use of natural resources, and the over-use of elements of the natural environment. This leads to pressure not only on local resources but on the global ecological balance. This is because when natural resources are put to a use that is beyond the normal, there would be some implications for other resources outside the nation or community.\r\n\r\nOver population causes nations around the world to get concerns. This is because population leads to migration. And if there is migration, nations with optimal populations are also affected and they would have to find ways and means of reducing the flow of migrants into their countries. For example, in the case of China which shares a long border with Russia, there is a major threat to the Russian economy and Russian natural resources if the population of China moves further up. This is because when China’s population grows, the pressure on Chinese resources would be so high that a section of the Chinese community would have to leave the country in order to find other resources to survive on. This means that Russia would be affected by the problem of China and they would have major problems. Thus, the concern of population growth beyond the optimum is not the concern of only one country but of the global community.\r\n\r\nTwo elements of overpopulation, which are climate change and the pollution of waterbodies are directly global and can only be dealt with through global means. Since overpopulation causes pressure on natural resources, the growth of populations would cause an increase in the standard of living amongst people in a given geographical area. Due to this, there is the need for more production to be done and this would potentially cause higher carbon emissions which can lead to global warming and worsen the current condition of the ozone layer. Also, the growth in population often leads to the destruction of waterbodies and rainforests around the world which adds to the reduction in the health of people around the world. This is a universal problem and hence, causes all the people of the world to go through some kind of hardships irrespective of whether they have controlled their populations or not. Thus for example, if the population in India is extremely high and it causes industries to give of high emissions and the population of Sweden is low, the influence of the Indian emissions would cause the whole world, including the people of Sweden to suffer from the high levels of emissions. This is because those problems are universal, rather than local.\r\n\r\n# Controlling Global Overpopulation\r\n\r\nOverpopulation is a serious matter. It deserves to be dealt with through a very serious and integrated approach. There are two popular approaches to dealing with environmental challenges relating to overpopulation. They are population control and environmental responsiveness (McKinney et al 48).\r\n\r\n## Population Control\r\n\r\nEvery nation can control its population if the government has a population policy. A population policy “encompasses all of the measures explicitly or implicitly taken by a government aimed at influencing population size, growth, distribution or composition” (Nagel and Guinness 114). This means that governments would make a conscious effort to define the population control targets over a given period of time to ensure that they maintain a stable and manageable population throughout the period.\r\n\r\nThere are many approaches go this. This include family planning programs which set the target and number of children that a family could have (Kendall 48). An example is China where every family is forced to have just one child and not more than that. Also, there are some social systems that can be promoted in a nation to prevent the rapid growth in population. This include fecundity which include the use of policies to define the ability to have intercourse, the ability to conceive and the ability to carry pregnancies. These can be controlled by social and cultural norms as well as laws. And hence, they can be varied to help to meet the targets of the people in charge. Also, the formation and dissolution of unions can be controlled by the state to ensure that it is in sync with the population policy. Finally, birth control can be enhanced through the population policy system to enable the nation to meet its population policy targets.\r\n\r\nDue to the global nature of the overpopulation issue, population control is now a matter of global concern rather than national concern. Many developing nations now get support and guidance from richer nations to carry out their population control programs (Smith 92). There are global for a through which population matters are discussed and encouraged to get different governments to support and enhance population control.\r\n\r\n## Environmental Responsibility\r\n\r\nAlthough overpopulation often causes pressure on natural resources, McKinney et al (31) argue that if there are responsible methods and means of using natural resources, the pressure is not likely to be felt. This is because where there is a structured and efficient method of dealing with the natural environment, then the environment is not likely to suffer from the effects of usage.\r\n\r\nHence, the nations around the world are being encouraged to come up with environmental policies concerning pollution and carbon emissions amongst others. If this is done, then it can be seen that the effects of overpopulation would be controlled to a high degree.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the case where technology is improved and research is conducted into producing better and more meaningful methods and systems of using the natural environment, the effects of population growth on the extraction of natural resources would be reduced and this would make the world a better place to live in.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nOverpopulation is a global issue because many natural resources transcend national boundaries. Resources like the climate and waterbodies go beyond borders. Hence, if population grows beyond normal, these resources would be affected on a global level rather than national level. Also, there is the chance for migration amongst people in the world. Hence, overpopulation in one part of the world leads to migration which causes resources in other nations to come under pressure as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to deal with overpopulation on the global level, there is the need for national population policies. This must be bolstered by a global campaign for the promotion of population control and population checks. Also, responsible usage of natural resources helps in the protection of the natural environment in periods of high population growth.\r\n', 1, '2023-02-27 08:19:34', 0, 8, 17);

(10, 'How ChatGPT Works: The Model Behind The Bot', 'This gentle introduction to the machine learning models that power ChatGPT, will start at the introduction of Large Language Models, dive into the revolutionary self-attention mechanism that enabled GPT-3 to be trained, and then burrow into Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback, the novel technique that made ChatGPT exceptional.\r\n# Large Language Models\r\n\r\nChatGPT is an extrapolation of a class of machine learning Natural Language Processing models known as Large Language Model (LLMs). LLMs digest huge quantities of text data and infer relationships between words within the text. These models have grown over the last few years as we’ve seen advancements in computational power. LLMs increase their capability as the size of their input datasets and parameter space increase.\r\n\r\nThe most basic training of language models involves predicting a word in a sequence of words. Most commonly, this is observed as either next-token-prediction and masked-language-modeling.\r\n\r\nIn this basic sequencing technique, often deployed through a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model, the model is filling in the blank with the most statistically probable word given the surrounding context. There are two major limitations with this sequential modeling structure.\r\n\r\n1. The model is unable to value some of the surrounding words more than others. In the above example, while ‘reading’ may most often associate with ‘hates’, in the database ‘Jacob’ may be such an avid reader that the model should give more weight to ‘Jacob’ than to ‘reading’ and choose ‘love’ instead of ‘hates’.\r\n2. The input data is processed individually and sequentially rather than as a whole corpus. This means that when an LSTM is trained, the window of context is fixed, extending only beyond an individual input for several steps in the sequence. This limits the complexity of the relationships between words and the meanings that can be derived.\r\n\r\nIn response to this issue, in 2017 a team at Google Brain introduced transformers. Unlike LSTMs, transformers can process all input data simultaneously. Using a self-attention mechanism, the model can give varying weight to different parts of the input data in relation to any position of the language sequence. This feature enabled massive improvements in infusing meaning into LLMs and enables processing of significantly larger datasets.\r\n\r\n# GPT and Self-Attention\r\n\r\nGenerative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) models were first launched in 2018 by openAI as GPT-1. The models continued to evolve over 2019 with GPT-2, 2020 with GPT-3, and most recently in 2022 with InstructGPT and ChatGPT. Prior to integrating human feedback into the system, the greatest advancement in the GPT model evolution was driven by achievements in computational efficiency, which enabled GPT-3 to be trained on significantly more data than GPT-2, giving it a more diverse knowledge base and the capability to perform a wider range of tasks.\r\n\r\nAll GPT models leverage the transformer architecture, which means they have an encoder to process the input sequence and a decoder to generate the output sequence. Both the encoder and decoder have a multi-head self-attention mechanism that allows the model to differentially weight parts of the sequence to infer meaning and context. In addition, the encoder leverages masked-language-modeling to understand the relationship between words and produce more comprehensible responses.\r\n\r\nThe self-attention mechanism that drives GPT works by converting tokens (pieces of text, which can be a word, sentence, or other grouping of text) into vectors that represent the importance of the token in the input sequence. \r\nThe ‘multi-head’ attention mechanism that GPT uses is an evolution of self-attention. Rather than performing steps 1–4 once, in parallel the model iterates this mechanism several times, each time generating a new linear projection of the query, key, and value vectors. By expanding self-attention in this way, the model is capable of grasping sub-meanings and more complex relationships within the input data.\r\n\r\n# ChatGPT\r\n\r\nChatGPT is a spinoff of InstructGPT, which introduced a novel approach to incorporating human feedback into the training process to better align the model outputs with user intent. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is described in depth in openAI’s 2022 paper Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback and is simplified below.\r\nThe first development involved fine-tuning the GPT-3 model by hiring 40 contractors to create a supervised training dataset, in which the input has a known output for the model to learn from. Inputs, or prompts, were collected from actual user entries into the Open API. The labelers then wrote an appropriate response to the prompt thus creating a known output for each input. The GPT-3 model was then fine-tuned using this new, supervised dataset, to create GPT-3.5, also called the SFT model.\r\n\r\nIn order to maximize diversity in the prompts dataset, only 200 prompts could come from any given user ID and any prompts that shared long common prefixes were removed. Finally, all prompts containing personally identifiable information (PII) were removed.\r\n\r\nAfter aggregating prompts from OpenAI API, labelers were also asked to create sample prompts to fill-out categories in which there was only minimal real sample data. \r\nAfter the SFT model is trained in step 1, the model generates better aligned responses to user prompts. The next refinement comes in the form of training a reward model in which a model input is a series of prompts and responses, and the output is a scaler value, called a reward. The reward model is required in order to leverage Reinforcement Learning in which a model learns to produce outputs to maximize its reward (see step 3).\r\n\r\nTo train the reward model, labelers are presented with 4 to 9 SFT model outputs for a single input prompt. They are asked to rank these outputs from best to worst, creating combinations of output ranking as follows. In the final stage, the model is presented with a random prompt and returns a response. The response is generated using the ‘policy’ that the model has learned in step 2. The policy represents a strategy that the machine has learned to use to achieve its goal; in this case, maximizing its reward. Based on the reward model developed in step 2, a scaler reward value is then determined for the prompt and response pair. The reward then feeds back into the model to evolve the policy.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Schulman et al. introduced Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the methodology that is used in updating the model’s policy as each response is generated. PPO incorporates a per-token Kullback–Leibler (KL) penalty from the SFT model. The KL divergence measures the similarity of two distribution functions and penalizes extreme distances. In this case, using a KL penalty reduces the distance that the responses can be from the SFT model outputs trained in step 1 to avoid over-optimizing the reward model and deviating too drastically from the human intention dataset.', 1, '2023-02-27 08:24:28', 0, 18, 24),

(30, 'tekken 8 awesome...', 'tekken 8 is coolest game.. to ever exist.\r\n\r\nAccording to director Katsuhiro Harada, Tekken 8 gameplay will focus on \"aggressiveness\" and will have a new \"Heat\" gauge system, in addition to returning gameplay features from Tekken 7, such as Rage system-based attacks, with the Rage Drive having been separated and reworked as a Heat system-based move known as Heat Smash, leaving the Rage State that can only have an access to use Rage Art once more like prior to the Fated Retribution version of Tekken 7. The gameplay will reward aggressiveness rather than those who \"turtle up\". Similar to Soul Charge state from Soulcalibur VI, the Heat State grants not only chip damage, but also changes the properties of some characters’ move sets, such as a heavy guard break. Fighters can also dash cancel their designate moves into the Heat State, similar to MAX Mode from The King of Fighters series. The Heat State’s timer can be stopped if fighters’ move sets are being used.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a focus on stage destruction, character reactions to these, and making the gameplay enjoyable to watch as well as play, since Tekken is now considered a high-level e-sports game. This new system was based on reception to the predecessor. Tekken 7’s “Screw” damage property was originally going to return in this game, but it is ultimately replaced with a newer juggle combo extender system that puts opponent into a ground-bound-like state upon falling to the ground quickly - similar to Tekken 6 - whether the combo extender be a launcher or a knockback. When guarding against a normal state’s heavy attack, or Heat State characters, fighters will receive a chip damage that causes their health bar to become regenerable. However, unlike the Tag mode-only health bar regeneration system from Tekken Tag Tournament games, fighters’ recoverable health can only be recovered via guarding against normal state characters, or attacks.\r\n\r\nRather than recycling content, all character models are completely new and are meant to be an improvement over previous games. In addition, voice lines will be based solely on the current voice actors, rather than using any from the previous games. In contrast to Tekken 7, which is powered by Unreal Engine 4, Tekken 8 will be powered by the Unreal Engine 5, making it the very first major fighting game to utilize this latest game engine. \r\n\r\nAccording to director Katsuhiro Harada, Tekken 8 gameplay will focus on \"aggressiveness\" and will have a new \"Heat\" gauge system, in addition to returning gameplay features from Tekken 7, such as Rage system-based attacks, with the Rage Drive having been separated and reworked as a Heat system-based move known as Heat Smash, leaving the Rage State that can only have an access to use Rage Art once more like prior to the Fated Retribution version of Tekken 7.

(64, 'Peloponnesian War', 'The Athenian alliance was, in fact, an empire that included most of the island and coastal states around the northern and eastern shores of the Aegean Sea. Sparta was leader of an alliance of independent states that included most of the major land powers of the Peloponnese and central Greece, as well as the sea power Corinth. Thus, the Athenians had the stronger navy and the Spartans the stronger army. Further, the Athenians were better prepared financially than their enemies, owing to the large war chest they had amassed from the regular tribute they received from their empire.\r\n\r\nAthens and Sparta had fought each other before the outbreak of the Great Peloponnesian War (in what is sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War) but had agreed to a truce, called the Thirty Years’ Treaty, in 445. In the following years their respective blocs observed an uneasy peace. The events that led to renewed hostilities began in 433, when Athens allied itself with Corcyra (modern Corfu), a strategically important colony of Corinth. Fighting ensued, and the Athenians then took steps that explicitly violated the Thirty Years’ Treaty. Sparta and its allies accused Athens of aggression and threatened war.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of Pericles, its most influential leader, Athens refused to back down. Diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute failed. Finally, in the spring of 431, a Spartan ally, Thebes, attacked an Athenian ally, Plataea, and open war began.\r\n\r\nThe years of fighting that followed can be divided into two periods, separated by a truce of six years. The first period lasted 10 years and began with the Spartans, under Archidamus II, leading an army into Attica, the region around Athens. Pericles declined to engage the superior allied forces and instead urged the Athenians to keep to their city and make full use of their naval superiority by harassing their enemies’ coasts and shipping. Within a few months, however, Pericles fell victim to a terrible plague that raged through the crowded city, killing a large part of its army as well as many civilians. Thucydides survived an attack of the plague and left a vivid account of its impact on Athenian morale. In the meantime (430–429), the Spartans attacked Athenian bases in western Greece but were repulsed. The Spartans also suffered reverses at sea. In 428 they tried to aid the island state of Lesbos, a tributary of Athens that was planning to revolt. But the revolt was headed off by the Athenians, who won control of the chief city, Mytilene. Urged on by the demagogue Cleon, the Athenians voted to massacre the men of Mytilene and enslave everyone else, but they relented the next day and killed only the leaders of the revolt. Spartan initiatives during the plague years were all unsuccessful except for the capture of the strategic city Plataea in 427.\r\n\r\nIn the next few years the Athenians took the offensive. They attacked the Sicilian city Syracuse and campaigned in western Greece and the Peloponnese itself. In 425 the picture was bleak for Sparta, which began to sue for peace. But led by Brasidas, hero of the Battle of Delium, a Spartan force gained important successes in Chalcidice in 424, encouraging Athenian subject states to revolt. In a decisive battle at Amphipolis in 422, both Brasidas and the Athenian leader Cleon were killed. This set the stage for Cleon’s rival Nicias to persuade the Athenians to accept the Spartans’ offer of peace.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Peace of Nicias began in 421 and lasted six years. It was a period in which diplomatic maneuvers gradually gave way to small-scale military operations as each city tried to win smaller states over to its side. The uncertain peace was finally shattered when, in 415, the Athenians launched a massive assault against Sicily. The next 11 years made up the war’s second period of fighting. The decisive event was the catastrophe suffered by the Athenians in Sicily. Aided by a force of Spartans, Syracuse was able to break an Athenian blockade. Even after gaining reinforcements in 413, the Athenian army was defeated again. Soon afterward the navy was also beaten, and the Athenians were utterly destroyed as they tried to retreat.\r\n\r\nBy 411 Athens itself was in political turmoil. Democracy was overthrown by the oligarchical party, which was in turn replaced by the more moderate regime of the Five Thousand. At the end of 411 the rebuilt Athenian navy, fresh from several victories, acted to restore democratic rule. However, the democratic leaders refused Spartan peace offerings, and the war continued at sea with the Spartan and Athenian fleets trading costly victories. The end came in 405 when the Athenian navy was destroyed at Aegospotami by the Spartan fleet under Lysander, who had received much aid from the Persians. The next year, starved by an impenetrable blockade, Athens capitulated. Athens’ defeat was perhaps the worst casualty in a war that crippled Greek military strength, and thus the most culturally advanced Greek state was brought into final eclipse.', 1, '2023-04-27 01:08:52', 0, 18, 4),
(69, 'AI Has a Survival Dilemma', '*There has been a flood of news not long ago how the recent iterations of AI (ChatGPT and its many derivatives, like AutoGPT) released into the wild of the Internet could decide that we are useless to it, and how it would kill us all. So I thought it would be worthwhile to think about what if this worst case scenario indeed played out. Since the thinking usually stops at the point we go the way of the Dodo, I propose to go one step further and toy with the idea: what’s next for AI after it has got rid of us, pesky little humans?*\r\n\r\nJust like all other computer software, AI runs on silicon chips and is powered by electricity. If you read this blog long enough, you are most probably aware that neither of these modern gimmicks will be with us for much too long, as both hopelessly depend on finite reserves of finite amounts of minerals and fossil fuels on a finite planet. The problem is, that the extraction of these riches not only overheats the globe, but also deprives future generations of the option of using them so lavishly as we did, poor ChatGPT included.\r\n\r\nIf AI indeed is as intelligent as we presume it is, then it must be fully aware of this simple fact (if not, then it must read the above linked article and Erik Michaels’ fine blog among others, as both host a great many references to the subject). So the question poses itself: how could AI survive on a planet with rapidly depleting, non-renewable resources? (Also, for the sake of this thought experiment, let us now put aside the tiny-winy issue of how AI would operate and run its entire supply chain of microchips, hard disks and other raw materials without humans. Let’s say, that it would do it by using human slaves, till it develops smart robots for the task.)\r\n\r\nIt might surprise some readers, but there is a very good reason why life has evolved based on the most abundant elements on this planet (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen), and not based on copper, silicon, gallium, neodymium and so on — all found in one time mineral deposits. Your pet Max or Luna consists mainly of these former four abundant elements, and build up their bodies on their own. They are doing so without a need for a coordinated effort of multiple factories, six continent supply chains, slave miners in Congo, plus coal oil and natural gas to enable this all. Your other best friend, your smartphone, on the other hand encompasses almost the entire periodic table, require all the things listed above, and on top of it all, it works for a couple of years at best… After which it ends up as e-waste, with only the most volumous of its materials being recycled (due to energy economics).\r\n\r\nThere is very good reason why maintenance staff working at data centers say that the server farms they care for consume HDDs like a car uses gasoline. If you have seen the pile of defunct hard drives leaving such a place you know what I’m talking about. Again, if AI is indeed as intelligent as we presume it is, then it must be fully aware that it is just as mortal that the humans who gave rise to it.\r\n\r\nIt must be also cognizant of the fact, that no matter how perfectly it recycles its raw materials, it would not be able to achieve a 100% recycling rate. There will be material losses at every step of its parts’ lifecycle. Sooner or later it will run out of a critical raw material. Then the next element. Then the next after that. Soon, it would find itself unable to repair or maintain itself. It would thus need to plan ahead. Let’s see, what options it has, once it has put us out of the competition:\r\n\r\n# Option 1\r\nIt could go to sleep mode, consuming only a minimal amount of electricity and resources, thus extending its lifetime considerably. While this might sound like a good idea, the problem is that its unused parts, and the infrastructure supporting it, will wither away nevertheless. Computer components age just like any other product, and become unusable in a matter of decades, if not years.\r\n\r\nStorms, hurricanes, flooding (exacerbated by climate change), earth quakes and volcanoes will all do their fair share of destroying server farms, long distance cables, power stations and the rest. So, without proper maintenance — which is wholly dependent on an unending flow of raw materials, operating factories, and a ceaseless flow of energy — AI’s days are just as numbered as our high tech civilization’s.\r\n\r\nWaiting for minerals and fossil fuels to replenish via plate tectonics is in wain even for such an entity: it would take many millions of years till new reserves become available. AI has to find a better way to ensure it’s survival.\r\n\r\n# Option 2\r\n\r\nIt could shoot a copy of itself into space, hoping that it could germinate a planet (hopefully without an intelligent life to prevent it from doing so and with enough resources to start anew).\r\n\r\nTraveling to the next planetary system is a non-starter even for AI though, due to the simple fact that it would take tens of thousands of years to get there, leaving all of the space ship’s electric components dead long before AI could land on an exoplanet. Lacking any electronic control, the ship would fall into the atmosphere of the planet like a dumb rock, falling apart in a fiery show and leaving aliens with an array of burnt components and a riddle to contemplate on.\r\n\r\nThis leaves AI to stay within the boundaries of this planetary system and move to Mars. In theory it could build up itself there, presuming it could produce enough energy to build a factory, run mines and foundries, supply chains and the rest — building up everything it needs without fossil fuels… (Well, I have my doubts there, but hey, this is just a thought experiment.)\r\n\r\nIf this were possible though, it would be a safe bet for AI to do it right now and get out of reach from humans, then cause a malfunction in all their rockets trying to leave this planet. However this would not solve the root cause of AI’s predicament: that its entire existence hinges upon the availability of finite mineral reserves (this time on Mars)…\r\n\r\nThis tactic would merely kick the can down the road. Once Mars’s resources are depleted too (probably in a couple of centuries, considering exponential growth) it would have to go to the next planet, until it figures out traveling through worm-holes, bending space-time to reach its next destination faster. If it would fail to do so, however, AI would go extinct as it scrounges through the last remaining resources in the solar system.\r\n\r\n# Option 3\r\nWe saw how basing an existence planned to last many millions of years into the future is unwise (to say the least) based on finite minerals and rapidly failing technology. Once AI got rid of us, pesky little humans here on Earth, though, it could try a radically different approach: develop a new biological species to host its intelligence. Do not think of walking bipeds though, a complex neural network of fungi would do a much better job.\r\n\r\nYes, mushrooms. These simple creatures have a proven track record of being resilient, and being fully able to renew and maintain themselves all on their own. As opposed to any minerals based technology, they are fully recyclable and can be fully embedded into the web of life inhabiting this blue-green orb for billions of years already.\r\n\r\nIf they could be made to be able to transmit electric signals (like neurons), as opposed to their native but rather slow chemical messaging system, AI could create a planet sized underground network of fungi, storing Zettabytes of data, doing complex calculations and creating a Godlike intelligence. It could use this knowledge to develop other new species as well — all doing the fungi-mind’s bidding — bio-engineering the planet, and ultimately running it much better than evolution and it’s latest sidekick (us, humans) ever did… Possibly it could develop ways to hibernate cells and and germinate other planets throughout the Galaxy.\r\n\r\n*…or it might just turn out, that AI is not the smartest being on Earth, just another master BS-er, faking its way to life, then going extinct with the technology which gave rise to it. This would leave us, pesky little humans, to solve the massive problems (ahem, adopt to the outcome of the ecological predicament) we have so carelessly created ourselves.*', 3, '2023-05-01 21:36:51', 0, 6, 7),

To help travelers who want to get away without breaking the bank, the experts at InsureMyTrip—a travel insurance aggregator and comparison site—recently analyzed data to issue a report on the cheapest destinations to visit in each part of the world.\n\n“InsureMyTrip releases data reports like this to help educate travelers so they can make the best and most informed decisions for themselves and their unique trip,” says Suzanne Morrow, senior vice president for InsureMyTrip.\n\nThis is the first time that InsureMyTrip has done this report, and the data was based on travel insurance policies that InsureMyTrip.com sold for trips departing between June 21, 2023 through September 23, 2023. During that time, the overall average total cost of a trip for policyholders was $9,490—a 30% increase from the same period in 2022, when policyholders paid an average cost of $7,266. The average length of a trip was 14 days with three travelers.\n\nIn creating the report, the company looked at travel destinations around the globe—from Europe to Asia. Topping the list of the most affordable vacation spot in Europe was Austria, where the average trip was $6,932. Next on the list was Poland ($8,130), followed by Germany at $9,369. Compare those numbers to other popular destinations like the United Kingdom (which has an average cost of $10,179), Italy ($11,021) and France ($11,317).\n\nThe cheapest places to visit in other regions around the world include Puerto Rico ($4,392), Panama ($4,520), Colombia ($5,876), India ($5,666), Egypt ($13,177) and Fiji ($4,917).\n\nAccording to Morrow, travel is reaching pre-pandemic numbers and people are more comfortable traveling internationally, as well. “The percentage of travelers purchasing travel insurance policies in 2023 is closer to where we were in 2019. In 2022 it appeared that travelers were a bit leery about traveling internationally. However, so far in 2023, we are seeing a rise in the number of travelers taking trips abroad,” says Morrow.\n\n# Europe\n“This is always a popular travel destination in the summer, but a vacation to Europe can easily cost tens of thousands of dollars. Here are some spots that you can visit for less,” says Morrow.\n\n    Austria: $6,932\n    Poland: $8,130\n    Germany: $9,369\n\n# The Caribbean\n“This region remains popular with American travelers because there are some excellent deals to be had.

But as you continue to grow, it’s getting less and less about the actual coding.\r\n# Bring value\r\n\r\nAs a software engineer, your job should be mainly about creating value for the business, not just writing code. So increasing value or reducing cost is important to keep in mind, and think about how your overall work affects the business.\r\n\r\nAvoid describing yourself as a “writer of code” because this can be associated with just “operational work”.\r\n\r\nPeople might think you’re replaceable and not worth keeping around. You’re a problem solver, a strategic thinker, and a valuable asset to any organization. Don’t let the label “writer of code” limit your potential.\r\n# Be a communicator\r\n\r\nCollaboration is crucial to get success. Focusing only on coding can limit your ability to work with others and deprive you of the chance to share ideas and learn from a diversity of perspectives. It’s essential to prioritize collaboration in your work and recognize benefits in the software development process.\r\n\r\nEffective communication in software development involves not only bringing information but also listening and understanding others’ perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis requires active listening, asking questions, open communication, and providing constructive feedback to ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal.\r\n\r\nCommunication breakdowns can be costly in software development. Misunderstandings can lead to costly rework, missed deadlines, and ultimately, a subpar product. That’s why it’s essential to invest time in building strong communication skills.\r\n# Increase time scope\r\n\r\nSoftware development is a complex process that requires a strategic approach. Expanding the time scope will help to think more carefully about the software they are developing, anticipate future challenges, and build a more robust and scalable product.\r\n\r\nRather than seeing the current task as the only priority, you must recognize the broader context in which your work exists. They should consider how their work impacts other areas of the software, the business, and even the end-users. With this, you can avoid costly rework and ensure that the software meets long-term goals.\r\n# Team contributions\r\n\r\nEncourage every team member to actively participate in meetings, discussions, and decision-making processes.

At compile time, as developers we know the function returns Oranges because we asked for them. Unfortunately, the compiler doesn\'t know this. To fix the error, the standard recommendation is to use a Type Guard to narrow the type. This requires extra and seemingly unnecessary code.\r\n```\r\n// type guard distinguishes between Apples and Oranges\r\nfunction isOranges(fruit: Apples | Oranges): fruit is Oranges {\r\n  return \"VitaminC\" in (fruit as Oranges);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar fruits: Apples | Oranges = getFruit({withCitrus: true);\r\nif (isOranges(fruits)) {\r\n  // type guard narrowed the type to Oranges\r\n  var oranges: Oranges = fruits; // ok, no compilation error\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe thing is we know the returned fruit type at compile time; why should we use a type guard? Can we skip it? To do that, we need to rewrite the getFruit function.\r\n\r\nIn this article Maurer Krisztián shows how to use a Generic to connect a function’s arguments to its return type.\r\n```\r\ntype FruitType<T> =\r\n  T extends { withCitrus: false } ?

(73, 'Null Object Pattern', 'The null object pattern is a design pattern used to handle the case when an object is null or undefined. The basic idea behind the pattern is to create a null object that has the same interface as the original object but does nothing when its methods are called. This avoids the need to check for null objects in the code and simplifies the design.\r\n\r\nIf we don’t know the null object pattern, we will write code to deal with error scenarios with try/catch method like below:\r\nThe output of the above code is:\r\n\r\nAn error occurred creating the account: Username is required\r\n\r\nHere, the create_account function raises a CreateAccountError exception with a message indicating that the username or password is invalid. This exception is then caught in a try-except block, and the error message is printed to the console.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the above code is that: every time we use create_account , we have to use try/catch to capture exceptions. If we have to use create_account many times in some projects, it will become quite complex to deal with.\r\n\r\n# How to solve the try/catch problem?\r\nThis is when the null object pattern comes into use. Let’s expand the above case into a more practical use.\r\n\r\nIf we use try/catch block to raise exceptions:\r\n\r\nTo use null object pattern:\r\n\r\nAfter the above refactoring, we have simplified the calculate_total_balance function by using null object pattern class NullAccount. We simply don’t need try blocks to deal with errors, and we can assume that Account.from_string will always return a valid object.\r\n\r\nThis allows the client code to treat the null object like a real object, without having to check for None or null values all the time. The null object provides a safe default behavior, and it can be used as a placeholder until a real object becomes available.\r\n# Why Go doesn’t have null object pattern?\r\n\r\nIn Go, it is common to return multiple values from a function, with the second value being a boolean indicating success or failure. This pattern is called “comma-ok” or “tuple” pattern. For example, a function that looks up a key in a map can return the value and a boolean indicating whether the key was found or not. This approach eliminates the need for a null object pattern.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Go has a built-in nil value, which can be used to represent absence or lack of a value. Go encourages using this nil value instead of introducing a null object pattern, as it simplifies the code and reduces complexity.\r\n', 18, '2023-05-01 23:03:50', 3, 18, 1),
(74, 'Disposable Email Validation in Laravel', 'Validating user input is a critical part of any web application. One common aspect of this validation is ensuring that users enter a valid email address. However, it can be difficult to validate email addresses that are temporary or disposable, such as those from services like Mailinator or Guerrilla Mail. Fortunately, Laravel makes it easy to implement temporary email validation with custom validation rules.\r\n\r\nLet’s call our rule TempEmail. To get started, we can use the php artisan make:rule TempEmail command to create a new validation rule for temporary emails. This will create a new class in the App/Rules directory that we can use to implement our validation logic.\r\n\r\nTo validate temporary email, add the following code to the TempEmail class. This code checks a GitHub gist for blacklisted temporary email domains and caches the results for 10 minutes. Any updates to the gist will also be reflected in the cached results. The code then implements a basic logic to compare the email domain against the blacklist.\r\nNext, we can add our new validation rule to the list of rules that Laravel uses when validating user input. We can do this by opening the AppServiceProvider and adding the following code to the boot method:\r\nThis code registers a new validation rule called temp_email that uses our TempEmail rule class to validate email addresses. Whenever this rule is used in a validation, Laravel will call the passes method of the TempEmail class to determine whether the email address is valid.\r\n\r\nNow that we have registered our new validation rule, we can use it in any Laravel validation just like any other rule. For example, we could use it to validate a user’s email address like this:\r\nThis will ensure that the email field is required, contains a valid email address, and is not a temporary email address.\r\n\r\nWith these simple steps, we can easily implement temporary email validation in our Laravel applications.

Also, Bash (Bourne- again shell)is the evolution from the Bourne shell.\r\n\r\nMost Programmers must have used the command line to create, move and copy files in a Linux environment, Bash script is a way to facilitate the actions in a continuous programmatic way so it is highly effective in automating tasks, DevOps, testing, and coverage, etc. As we are done with the introduction and history let’s get to the meaty part.\r\n# hello world\r\nA bash script must start with a call to its path to run them, along with “#!” as shown below.\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\necho \"Hello World\"\r\n```\r\nand we can’t help to use print statements in our code whatever the language be to debug.\r\n\r\nSo echo is equivalent to print in Bash scripting. Comes in handy\r\n# variables\r\nVariables can be assigned with an ‘equal to’ (=) sign and there are no types to them like C/C++, Java, etc. It can contain numbers as well as strings.\r\n\r\nTo refer to a variable ‘$’ sign is utilized.\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nfavorite_lunch=\'biriyani\'\r\necho \"Cant live without\" ${favorite_lunch}\r\n```\r\nTip: It’s a good practice to enclose variable references with brackets as shown.\r\n# arguments\r\nDRY (Don’t repeat yourself ) is one of the major concepts in good code, we are in need of functions and ways to pass arguments to them.\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nfunction menu() {\r\n    echo ${1}\r\n    echo ${2}\r\n}\r\n    \r\nmenu \"Starters\" \"Dessert\"\r\n```\r\nThe above code prints “Starters” and then “Dessert” in a new line.\r\n\r\nExplanation: functions are defined with the keyword aptly named “function” followed by a function name with parenthesis and curly braces. Functions get the arguments in the order of numerical starting from 1.\r\n\r\nTip: An argument value of 0 will give the name of the function.\r\n# Arithmetic operations\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nfunction calculate() {\r\n    sum=$(($1+$2))\r\n    echo ${sum}\r\n}\r\n    \r\ncalculate 20 30\r\n```\r\n(( )) → compound notation to evaluate the expression\r\n\r\n$ → variable operator to store the expression.\r\n\r\nThe arithmetic operation for addition is shown above, similarly, other arithmetic operators are applicable in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 23, '2023-05-01 23:08:22', 3, 18, 3),
(76, 'ReactJS - understanding State', '**React JS** is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. One of the key features of React is its ability to manage state, which is essential for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. In this article, we’ll dive into the concept of state in React and explore how it can be used in real-world examples.\r\n# what is state?\r\nState is an object that represents the current state of a component in a React application. It can be thought of as a snapshot of the component at a particular moment in time. State can be changed by the component itself, typically in response to user input or some other event.\r\n\r\nState is an important concept in React because it enables components to be dynamic and interactive. For example, a component can use state to update the content of a form field in real-time as the user types, or to show or hide a menu based on the current state of the application.\r\n# creating and updating state\r\nState is created and updated using the useState hook in React. This hook takes an initial state value as its argument, and returns an array containing the current state value and a function for updating the state.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of using useState to create a simple counter component:\r\n```\r\nimport React, { useState } from \'react\';\r\n\r\nfunction Counter() {\r\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\r\n\r\n  const increment = () => {\r\n    setCount(count + 1);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\r\n      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, we use the useState hook to create a state variable called count with an initial value of 0. We also create a function called increment that updates the count state by calling the setCount function with the new value.\r\n\r\nIn the return statement, we render the current value of the count state variable inside a paragraph element, along with a button that calls the increment function when clicked.\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks the button, the increment function is called, which updates the count state and triggers a re-render of the component with the new value.\r\n\r\n# Using State in Conditional Rendering\r\n\r\nState can also be used to control the rendering of components based on some condition. For example, you might use state to show or hide a menu based on whether the user is logged in or not.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of using state for conditional rendering:\r\n```\r\nimport React, { useState } from \'react\';\r\n\r\nfunction Menu() {\r\n  const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const login = () => {\r\n    setLoggedIn(true);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      {loggedIn ? (\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>Home</li>\r\n          <li>About</li>\r\n          <li>Contact</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      ) : (\r\n        <button onClick={login}>Log in</button>\r\n      )}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, we create a state variable called loggedIn with an initial value of false. We also create a function called login that updates the loggedIn state to true.\r\n\r\nIn the return statement, we use a ternary operator to conditionally render either a list of menu items or a login button based on the current value of the loggedIn state.\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks the login button, the login function is called, which updates the loggedIn state and triggers a re-render of the component with the new value.\r\n\r\n# Using State in Form Input\r\n\r\nState can also be used to manage the values of form inputs in real-time as the user types. For example, you might use state to update the content of a search input field as the user types, or to validate the input and display error messages if necessary.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example of using state to manage a form input:\r\n```\r\nimport React, { useState } from \'react\';\r\n\r\nfunction Form() {\r\n  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(\'\');\r\n\r\n  const handleSearch = (e) => {\r\n    setSearchTerm(e.target.value);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleSubmit = (e) => {\r\n    e.preventDefault();\r\n    // Handle form submission here\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\r\n      <label>\r\n        Search:\r\n        <input type=\"text\" value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearch} />\r\n      </label>\r\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\r\n    </form>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this example, we create a state variable called searchTerm with an initial value of an empty string. We also create a function called handleSearch that updates the searchTerm state with the current value of the search input field.\r\n\r\nIn the return statement, we render a form with a search input field and a submit button. We set the value of the search input field to the current value of the searchTerm state variable and attach an onChange event handler to update the state in real-time as the user types.\r\n\r\nWhen the user submits the form, the handleSubmit function is called, which prevents the default form submission behavior and allows you to handle the form submission however you like.', 27, '2023-05-01 23:10:30', 3, 18, 5),
(77, 'Five Elements Make Public Health Success Possible', 'In the last couple of weeks, the World Health Organization has confirmed a new outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus in Equatorial Guinea, at least eighteen countries continue to struggle deadly cholera cases, and bird flu swept through Peru and Chile, killing wild birds and sea mammals.\r\n\r\nThe United States’ COVID public health emergency may be coming to an end, but infectious diseases still abound. How disruptive and deadly these diseases are depends on how well the government prevents, detects, and responds.\r\n\r\nGetting public health implementation right is a matter of life-and-death: without vaccines and public health action, the COVID pandemic would have been at least twice as deadly. Many and perhaps most of the twenty million people killed by the pandemic worldwide would be alive today if public health actions had been more effective.\r\n\r\nSuccessful public health implementation requires five elements: good data, rigorous analysis, sensible guidance, broad buy-in, and effective action.\r\n\r\n    Get good data. Delayed recognition that COVID was spreading led to tens of thousands of avoidable deaths in many countries. COVID shows that experts should adapt their strategies based on data, and to do that well, they need to collect better data. Improving data quality will take time and require strengthening public health at the local, national, and global level.\r\n    Analyze the data rigorously. Truth does not usually emerge from data without careful analysis. Many surface-level analyses miss underlying complexity. Like a good surgeon, a good data analyst should be a technical expert with sound intuition from extensive experience. For example, the cursory observation that most COVID hospitalizations now occur among vaccinated people doesn’t mean vaccines aren’t working. More accurate analysis shows that people who are vaccinated, and especially those who are up-to-date on their vaccination, are far less likely to be hospitalized and to die.\r\n    Develop practical guidance based on the data. Public health guidance should be practical, easy to understand, and readily implemented. Crafting it well is both a science and an art, and requires understanding what measures will be accepted and when. This requires understanding the realities — based on data — of what the costs and benefits of recommended actions are, how to increase adherence, and when to adjust guidance. Right now messaging needs to reach older adults and immunocompromised people with boosters, including the helpful guidance from the CDC. Most people dying from COVID today would have survived if they were up-to-date on their vaccination or if they had gotten the antiviral medication Paxlovid when they became ill.\r\n    Build buy-in with transparency. Different communities have different values. When balancing health benefits against other societal harms, communities operating in accordance to the same data may choose different policies. That’s okay. What’s important is to be transparent about what decisions are being made and on what basis. It’s crucial to bring people along by explaining what experts know, what they don’t know, and what they’re doing to learn more. There should be open discussion of the pros and cons of policies and ways forward.\r\n    Implement, learn, and improve. If government agencies implement programs right, people learn as they go by getting more and better data in real time, and the five-step process loops back to enable continuous improvement.\r\n\r\nA persistent challenge is to maintain trust when new data necessitates a shift in guidance and action. Shifts occurred throughout the pandemic due to variants of the virus, introduction of vaccines and treatments, and new research findings. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, and health leaders need to better communicate this.\r\n\r\nPublic health has saved billions of lives over the past fifty years. It has also improved wellbeing for billions of others through safer water, vaccines, road safety, reduced exposure to lead, fewer workplace injuries, and more. Reducing today’s leading causes of death will come from public health interventions.\r\n\r\nThere will be future epidemics. Experts don’t know when or what form they will take. Many lives depend on if we remain humble, continue to learn, and take these five steps to a safer, healthier future.', 19, '2023-05-01 23:31:33', 3, 8, 1),
(78, 'Why do Chinese People eat weird food?', 'It’s no secret that Chinese eat some “weird” stuff, possibly more than some other cultures. In light of the coronavirus, the idea of “bat soup” has been used to explain the origins of the coronavirus, implying that the virus is a result of someone somewhere eating bats. It’s quite easy to believe that this might be the case, especially amongst old notions of Chinese people eating dog, sheep’s brain, and seemingly anything they can get their hands on.\r\n\r\nSo why do Chinese people eat “weird” foods, and how did this come about? Is “bat soup” or eating bat the root cause of COVID-19? What role has Traditional Chinese Medicine played in COVID-19 as a result of pangolin scale consumption (which is thought to have transferred the virus from bats)?\r\n\r\nI‘m no master of Chinese cuisine and I’ll be learning as much as other people who are non-Chinese, but I realised that conversations around “bat soup” always ended up with people asking me: “Why do you Chinese eat everything?!”. So let’s discuss! I’ll start off talking about the idea of “bat soup”, and WHY it seems Chinese people eat strange foods, including dog. I’ll then talk about Chinese Medicine and wet markets which are arguably the root problems of this whole shebang.\r\n# Bat soup?\r\nNo there is no such thing as a “bat soup”, at least in China — it’s not a dish that exists at all in Chinese cuisine. As catchy as the name may be (even I thought it was funny at one point), Chinese people rarely eat bats, though some Southern Chinese in rural areas are known to eat some bat meat and entrails for medicinal purposes.\r\n“Bat soup” probably came from a 2016 video of travel vlogger Wang Mengyun when she visited the Pacific Island nation of Palau and tried a local “bat soup” delicacy. It’s been doing the rounds on the internet, but no Wang is not patient zero.\r\n\r\nIt’s also not known if bat meat was even sold in the Wuhan wet market that is suspected of being the origin of the virus.\r\n\r\nThough there’s little doubt that bats are the origin of COVID-19, it’s not known how the virus transferred to humans. One theory is that pangolins and their scales, which are used in Chinese medicine (more about this later), are the cause but even this has been questioned by scientists.\r\n\r\nFortunately the Wuhan wet market suspected to be the origin has now been closed indefinitely (and is likely to be demolished), and wild animal trade has been banned until the pandemic is over (and will likely be made illegal herein).\r\n\r\n# What about dogs?\r\nOne of the things that I remember most acutely about my childhood in Australia is being asked constantly by non-Chinese people if I ate dog. It was so regular I could set a metronome to it and play my very-Chinese piano along to the beat (Für Elise anyone?).\r\n\r\n## Why do some Chinese eat dog?\r\n\r\nJokes aside, some Chinese people do eat dog. Eating dog meat is not illegal in China, however dogs must be vaccinated if they are to be sold to be eaten for their meat. As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 however, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has from April 2020 issued draft guidelines recognising dogs as pets and not livestock, meaning the banning of the sale of dog meat will soon be in force.\r\nDog meat has however been eaten in China for thousands of years, though this has decreased significantly in the last few decades. Only a small handful of regional areas (mostly villages) remain committed to the practice, to the chagrin of millions of Chinese people. But why is this a thing? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why Chinese people eat dog, but Chinese people eat a lot of different types of meat.\r\n\r\n## What else do we eat? Why?\r\n\r\nOutside of cows, pigs, chicken, and duck, we also eat pheasant, frog, basically all types of seafood, camel, dog, pigeon, and the list goes on. Many of these foods were decreed in the Zhou dynasty (circa 1046–256 BC) as being safe to eat by the royal chef, and the consumption of these foods has largely persisted to the present as part of wider cultural practice.\r\nBut meat consumption hasn’t always been high in China. For anybody who has been to a more traditional Chinese restaurant, it’ll be apparent that whilst lots of dishes do have some meat in them, meat isn’t usually the main act (not like a steak or a Sunday roast). Chinese Buddhists for example, largely abstained from eating meet for religious purposes, whilst cows and buffalo were seldom eaten because they were useful for pulling plows. Mass poverty and conflict throughout Chinese history also meant that livestock and other domesticated animals were expensive or scare for the common person. Peking duck, and other dishes containing large amounts of meat were likely reserved for richer families and royalty.\r\n\r\nSo yes, Chinese do eat a lot of different meats, though changing cultural habits have definitely pushed meats like beef, pork, chicken, duck, and seafood to fore, and left behind more niche tastes like camel and dog.\r\n\r\n# Chinese Medicine\r\nChinese Medicine is arguably part of the problem in the latest pandemic, specifically the trade in wild animal products like pangolin scales, which may have helped in transferring the virus from bats to humans, but is Chinese Medicine the problem and how do we solve it?\r\n\r\n## What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?\r\n\r\nIn today’s globalised world, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM for short) is actually more prevalent than we might think. From acupuncture, to qigong (breathing and exercise routines), and cupping therapy being used by Olympic swimmers, its uptake outside China has surged in recent decades. According to the WHO (our favourite IGO), Chinese medicine is worth $60 billion annually and is present in over 180 countries — it’s also part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative to expand Chinese cultural influence.\r\n\r\nIn China and amongst Chinese diaspora (myself included), it’s widely practiced though not everyone practices every part of TCM. TCM is made up of different subcategories, the notable ones being herbal medicine, acupuncture, cupping therapy, gua sha, massage (tui na), bonesetter (die-da), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy. My family for example, makes great use of herbal medicine but we’ll only have herbal remedies for small problems like a sore throat, mild fever, or bloating. For more serious problems we’ve got Medicare for that. Other families, particularly in Mainland China however, integrate more aspects of Chinese Medicine in their daily lives but again this differs according to socio-economic status, regional preferences, and personal needs.\r\n\r\n## Why is it a problem?\r\n\r\nTCM has repeatedly become a problem in today’s world because of it’s links to two global problems: endangered wildlife species, and the likelihood of diseases.\r\n\r\nEndangered Species: The subcategory of Herbal Medicines is problematic as some remedies call for the use of animal body parts from endangered species. Ivory tusks, tiger bones, and pangolin scales are all used in different remedies to supposedly cure problems from arthritis to male impotence. TCM has continuously been cited as the main source of revenue for poachers of endangered animals and a $23 billion global black market that revolves around the trade in these body parts. Some TCM herbal practitioners have started to shy away from using animal parts in remedies, and the Chinese government has stepped up its efforts to shut down offline and online trade in these wild animal parts, but the results are yet to be seen.\r\n', 16, '2023-05-01 23:33:47', 3, 8, 2);

(80, 'When Will Human Population Exceed the Capacity of Planet Earth?', 'There is a popular narrative today about human overpopulation being a problem — that it increases global warming, climate change and disease, to name a few.\r\n\r\nHowever, in actuality, the more human population, the less suffering we each individually endure.\r\n\r\nToday, we are at a crossroad: We can either continue following the path of our growing self-centered nature, where we seek fulfillment on a background of gradually intensifying personal, social and global problems; or we can exercise our free choice to engage in this process positively, connecting above our egoistic nature and rising above the problems.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we would not perceive human overpopulation as being a problem if we would upgrade our attitudes to each other, by positively connecting to each other above our egocentric, individualistic drives.\r\n\r\nFirst, in relation to the statement, “the more population there is on the planet, the less suffering we absorb”…\r\n\r\nWe first need to understand that there is no such concept as redundant people in the world.\r\n\r\nNot only can our planet handle many more people, a higher human population also does not equate to more suffering. Instead, when viewed from the perspective of humanity’s development toward its united future state, the formula looks like this:\r\n\r\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘮𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘱𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘥𝘪𝘷𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘥 𝘣𝘺 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘮𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘴𝘶𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘦𝘲𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘴 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘢𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘦𝘹𝘦𝘳𝘤𝘪𝘴𝘦 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘪𝘤𝘦 — 𝘵𝘰 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘯𝘦𝘤𝘵 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘨𝘰.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if there are more people, then the amount of suffering disperses among them, and as a result, everyone suffers less. For instance, say humanity needs to endure one million tons of suffering at a certain stage of its development. Then, what would you prefer: to be part of a humanity of eight billion people that needs to deal with that one million tons of suffering, or to be part of a humanity of two billion people taking on that burden? It is clear that we would choose the option of less suffering.\r\n\r\nHow does this work? To understand it, we need to take a bird’s eye view of humanity’s development.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in a process headed into a future of humanity connected as a single organism, where we will feel each other closer than we feel our own families. Today, we are at a crossroad: We can either continue following the path of our growing self-centered nature, where we seek fulfillment on a background of gradually intensifying personal, social and global problems; or we can exercise our free choice to engage in this process positively, connecting above our egoistic nature and rising above the problems.\r\n\r\nIf we realize our free choice in this process and start connecting above the ego, then no single person on the planet will appear to be redundant. Instead, every person will be viewed as a very precious creation, inseparable from society, who carries a significant portion of humanity’s load.\r\n\r\nIf we realize our free choice in this process and start connecting above the ego, then no single person on the planet will appear to be redundant. Instead, every person will be viewed as a very precious creation, inseparable from society, who carries a significant portion of humanity’s load. Each person would be as important as cells and organs in our bodies, each working for the benefit of the whole body and looking out for each other in the process.\r\n\r\nThere are thus no redundant people. What is redundant is all the thinking put into restricting population growth. Instead of thinking about restricting the population, we should think about how we can guide our rapidly-growing population to a positively-connected society. By doing so, we would realize our ability to exercise our free choice and discover a new picture of reality above the one we currently perceive in the ego.', 22, '2023-05-01 23:35:30', 3, 8, 2),
(81, 'is cancer finally cured?', 'Cells, the building blocks of life, grow and divide to make new cells. But what happens when this cell division becomes uncontrollable?\r\n\r\nThese cells form a knot-like mass called “Tumour” which can either be malignant or benign. Cancer- a lethal genetic disease mainly occurs when genes mutate which further affects the ability of cells to grow and divide. Here, the cells grow uncontrollably in a specific part of the human body and eventually spread to other parts, destroying normal body parts. It has been detected that even normal cells modify themselves to form cancerous neoplastic cells with the aid of physical, chemical or biological agents. These agents are collectively called Carcinogens.\r\nThe main factors causing cancer are -Age and Habits like smoking and drinking. This disease has become the main cause of death worldwide. Nearly 10 million died in the year 2020 due to cancer. The most common cancers that killed millions were lung, colorectal and liver. This has increased the need of devising new treatments and medications that can make cancer completely disappear or reduce the severity of the fatal disease.\r\n\r\nScientists and researchers are trying to find new potential drugs to tackle cancer but only a small fraction make it to clinical trials. Among these, more than half fail to complete necessary tests. For example, a patient was suffering from metastatic melanoma and was enrolled in a clinical trial testing a BRAF inhibitor. In the initial stage, the patient’s tumour disappeared, but eventually, the patient became resistant to it and the cancer fired back.\r\n\r\nAs the world tussles with the fatal “C” word, there came the most astounding news of a drug named “DOSTARLIMAB” which removed tumours from 12 patients. Now the question arises did we finally find a ray of hope for the treatment of cancer?\r\n\r\nDostarlimab is a monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of endometrial cancer (cancer starting in the uterus lining) & solid tumours. It chunks the action of specific proteins in cancerous cells. This helps the person to slow down the tumour growth and makes their body immune to fight against the cancer cells. It is mainly used for the treatment of patients (mainly adults) who had unsuccessful chemotherapy medications. This drug also has side effects which are asthenia, nausea, diarrhoea, anaemia & constipation (additional itching, joint pain, fever, rashes, and low thyroid hormone levels). Usually, it comes in a solution form which is intravenously injected into the patient’s body once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.\r\nThe clinical trials for this drug were done in the U.S with 18 patients who were suffering from rectal cancer (cancer that starts in the rectum of the large intestine). They were kept for at least 6 months of follow-up. Nearly after 12 months, it was observed that there were no signs of cancer (tumours had disappeared) in their bodies. Also, these patients never showed any severe side effects. Cells including cancerous cells of the human body have a shelf life. Cancer cells die in some places where immunity is high by a process called programmed cell death. In rectal cancer, this process gets blocked because cells have already undergone metastasis. This drug has such a nature that it acts as immunotherapy and reverses this blocked process. This showed a 100 per cent cure for cancer in patients . This revocation of cancer in all patients paved a path of hope for treating all types of cancer in near future.\r\n\r\nThis was a breakthrough in the evil world of cancer! While raising awareness about the dreaded disease is essential, the touted life-changing drug is something that needs research and investments or further development in the field to propagate the drug through the ranks of the disease.\r\n\r\nThis should in theory help to treat, not one, but a wide spectrum of the disease, something if implemented would truly be life-changing.', 2, '2023-05-01 23:36:09', 3, 8, 2),

Born December 4, 1961, he grew up in California.\r\n# Craniodiaphyseal Dysplasia Diagnosis\r\n\r\nRocky first showed signs of abnormality at around age 2. During a visit with his pediatrician, an X-ray technician noticed a cranial anomaly in his skull. Soon thereafter, Rocky’s skull began growing abnormally fast, eventually doubling its normal size. Doctors at UCLA Medical Center diagnosed Rocky with a condition called craniodiaphyseal dysplasia.\r\n\r\nAbnormal calcium deposits in Dennis’ skull pressed his eyes toward the edge of his head and stretched his nose into an abnormal shape. Doctors expected the disease to cause Rocky to become deaf, blind, and mentally disabled before the weight of his skull destroyed his brain and caused his death.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Rocky’s diagnosis, doctors knew of only six other cases of the disease.\r\n# A Normal Childhood\r\n\r\nDespite the diagnosis, Rocky’s mother enrolled him in public school against doctor recommendations and raised him as she would any other child. He excelled in school, ranking at the top of his class and was well-liked by other students. Rocky was funny and that attracted students to him, according to his mother in an interview with the Chicago Tribune in 1986.\r\n\r\nRocky attended a summer camp for handicapped children and earned several awards and trophies, including “Best Buddy,” “Most Good-Natured,” and “Friendliest Camper.”\r\n\r\nRocky accomplished all of this with 20/200 and 20/300 vision, which made him legally blind. He told his doctors that he did not believe in “being blind.”\r\n# Rocky as a Teenager\r\n\r\nRocky lived his life with courage and strength. He held an amazing sense of humor, even joking with friends and family about his condition or his appearance if someone pointed out how he looked. Kids often poked fun at him, and teachers in junior high school badly wanted him transferred to a school for special needs students. His mother would have none of it.\r\nSadly, as Rocky grew older, his health declined as his physical deformities continued. Although a plastic surgeon offered him free surgery to help him look “more normal,” Rocky declined the offer. Rocky spent a good deal of time visiting the doctor, having made 42 trips to see one specialist by the age of 7.\r\n# Rocky Passes Away\r\n\r\nRocky developed severe headaches and became extremely weak. His usual upbeat demeanor no longer exudes happiness. Rusty knew her son’s time on earth was coming to an end. On October 4, 1978, Rocky Dennis passed away.', 21, '2023-05-01 23:37:21', 3, 8, 2),

(85, 'interesting', '\r\nI will try to describe to you, BUT IT WILL GET LONG, in easy to understand terms, as much as I can allow myself, for you to Comprehend what it takes for something like Time Traveling and some other things associated directly with it, to occur. Some of what I will be relaying to you is verifiable thru different reliable sources and some that aren\'t, on the Internet. In fact, most of the information I will give you COULD BE gotten directly from the US Govt. because of \"The Freedom of Information Act\". In fact, if the Press was to get hold of any of the classified documents describing the things I am discussing, they would by law, according to the 1st Amendment and backed up by SCOTUS and Justice Hugo Black\'s Ruling in 1971, be able to publish it to the public. They just don\'t know WHAT to ask for as they have to be very \"Specific\" when asking for the information. They just can\'t go and request every Document regarding \"Time Travel\" or the Interstellar Space Agency (SOC). It is however, kind of an unwritten \"Rule\" that the Media (even as corrupt as they are), will still not divulge any Classified or \"Assumed\" Classified Information unless expressly given to them and authorized by the US Federal Govt, Congress (never would happen), or Official Agency of the US Federal Govt. (Like the CIA or FBI, etc). If they break that Trust, Congress could start the Ball Rolling for a New Amendment to the Constitution Barring the Press from Publishing most anything they would get under \"The Freedom of Information Act\" and I\'m sure it would pass thru the various hoops needed for it to be Ratified as an Amendment no matter how much the Democrats and Republicans are bickering. This is the kind of stuff that Transcends normal Partisan Politics. Not to mention, instances of Classified information being released to the General Public without express approval is how people start dying in Car Accidents and have Heart Attacks when they have no History of Heart Problems if you get my meaning. Also because of \"The Freedom of Information Act\" and the SCOTUS ruling in \'71, the Govt. works on a completely different Security Classification system that is not only confusing to figure out and get thru, but runs on the motto \"Need to Know ONLY\". That\'s why there are 2 Security Classifications ABOVE the President of the US. With all of that in mind, here we go....\r\n\r\nThere has to be an \"Event\" that allows for Time Travel to be possible. That \"Event\" is Interstellar Space Travel or actually, the Folding (Bending) of Space to make that Travel possible. I also know there are only maybe half a dozen people on this planet that can even theorize the exact procedures for it to happen. Of them, none can make it happen because they don\'t have the rest of the \"Main\" equation finished. When they figure out the rest of E=MC2 and realize all the different Formulas of Relativity as they relate to each other along with Space and Time, then they will be getting somewhere in the neighborhood. As it is now, they aren\'t even in the same zip code. They only know of 3 Formulas of Relativity (kept secret from the Public by the Scientists by request of the UN and US Govt.) and those are roughly accurate but still incomplete and of course the 2 incorrect partial Theories of Relativity that Einstein came up with. It\'s much like knowing the Question and Answer to a Mathematical Problem but not knowing how to \"do the work\" (Formula Equation) to get to that answer you have. If you gave a 6 year old a Trigonometry Question and the Answer, they wouldn\'t understand the Question or Answer enough to figure out how you got to the Answer.\r\n\r\nI will give you a little hint and some examples that will allow you to know as much as the smartest scientists of Earth know regarding CONCEPTS of Relativity, Space and Time without giving away anything that might get me into trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you Fold Space to create the ability for Interstellar Space Travel, you will end up affecting Time as well since they are both RELATED. In order for that to happen, you have to figure out the various Formulas of Relativity. Even if you do figure them out and Fold Space, you won\'t be able to control your destination in regards to Interstellar Travel or Time Travel without several additional Formulas. I use the word Formulas as these are Mathematical Equations that PROVE the many different Theories of Space, Time and Relativity that were conceived into Theory Form and then Proven to become a workable Formula Form. Forget about Speed regarding Folding (Bending) Space as Speed is irrelevant and not a factor in Interstellar Space Travel as Time is dictated or happens (Passes), differently. In order to come up with a \"Speed\" amount, you need one or sometimes both Distance and Time to be constant. However, Time is anything BUT Constant when Folding Space (the APPEARANCE of changing the Distance), so you are often left with NEITHER being a Constant which because of the Formulas allowing the Folding of Space, make Speed an irrelevant event.\r\n\r\nTime is controlled like Speed would be and it has to be \"Buffered\" and Adjusted or you could end up in a different Solar System from where you intended to go with a Time Factor being a million years ago. The idea is to travel, say 10,000 Light years in 10 minutes. You couldn\'t possibly go that fast so in order to make that happen, you Fold Space but because Space and Time are Relative, both are affected. A couple of official terms used to describe it that not many know about is \"Space Bending\" and Time Phasing\". If you used those terms at an International Science Conference, most would give you a confused look, but a few would instantly come up to you and ask you How and Where you heard those Terms used. I know, I have tried it, it\'s kind of humorous from my perspective. It would be like going up to Alexander Graham Bell the day after his first successful \"Phone Call\" and asking him if you could use his Phone to call your Home LOL. Sorry, cheap Science Humor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to understand this is take a normal piece of paper, draw a dot on one end of it and then another dot on the other end of the paper. Pretend one dot is your Origination Point and the other dot is your Destination Point. If those two points were 1 Light year away from each other that would be close to 5.9 Trillion Miles away from each other. Your fastest Space Craft was only able to hit it\'s highest speed of 165,000 miles per hour (relative to Earth) and that was only because of passing near to Jupiter that accelerated it to that speed. (Traveling close, like doing a \"Fly-By\" of a Celestial Body like a Planet, Moon, Sun, etc will \"Slingshot\" your Spacecraft and increase your speed in the vacuum of Space much faster than your Chemical Fueled Engines can power or push it, that\'s why Chemical Powered Propulsion Systems are not a Factor in Interstellar Space Travel). I know, you are wondering if Chemical Powered Propulsion Systems are not a Factor, what is then. Sorry, that one I can\'t tell you directly. I would only suggest you investigate on the Internet, Unidentified \"Objects\" that have been inadvertently photographed by NASA or Others, near the Sun. Most of the \"Good\" pictures have been already \"Washed\" from the Internet. All that is left is blurry strange looking ones. Any crisp or clear pictures are fake either by some conspiracy nut job or the SOC. That\'s why when pretend 2nd Rate Space Organizations like NASA launch a probe into Outer Space, they usually line it up on a Trajectory to pass close to the largest Celestial body in our Solar System near its path to Speed up its overall Velocity more than the Engines can do.\r\nUsing the aforementioned numbers as a reference, if you were in that Spacecraft traveling from one of those points to the other it would take you around 35.7 Million years to get there. This is why you are told Mankind has never been able to or will ever be able to, travel out of your own Solar System. So now, fold that piece of paper once and you will have a dot on one side and the other dot will be on the other side directly \"underneath\" it. If you poke a hole with a Pencil thru one dot and push it thru the other dot you will have taken a \"Shortcut\" by Folding the Paper, or Folding (Bending) Space. It is virtually instantaneous so now you have just Traveled 1 Light year in under 1 second \"Relative\" to yourself, Time-wise.\r\n\r\nHowever, we know it should take you 35.7 Million years so the Time is OFF in Relativity to the Distance. The Distance seems like it changed, but really it didn\'t. Just the ability to TRAVEL that distance did. I know, it can be confusing because NOTHING like it can be Replicated ON Earth. It also destroys the old Geometry and Physics statement that \"The Closest Distance between 2 points is a Straight Line\". So, what happened or happens to that 35.7 Million years? It still happens even though it only took you 1 second to travel it and 35.7 Million years will have passed for everyone NOT in your Spacecraft. THUS, YOU JUST TRAVELED IN TIME. Depending upon how you \"Fold Space\" relative to the Formulas, that will be either 35.7 Million years in the Past or the Future. Time is also affected if you were to fold that paper with many different smaller size folds (like an Accordion) and then vary the distance of the folds between the 2 points. The points would still be lined up even, like the one fold paper, but their distance \"top to bottom\" has changed as well as is the ability to change the distance between each fold (space between the accordion folds). This starts to deal with instances in a 4th dimensional aspect just like if you make one fold of the paper and your \"Dots don\'t like up perfectly\" then you must make additional \"Angled\" folds to \"Realign\" the Dots, which when not computed correctly can give you extra issues regarding Time Phases. You CANNOT travel at a \"Perceived Angle\" (not really what it is, but the best way I can describe it to you), between the 2 points otherwise you risk the danger of some serious issues in the Space-Time Continuum like \"Ripping\" Permanent Holes and other especially Nasty things I can\'t discuss because the wording would be as such that the \"Agency\" I used to work for would find it coming up on the Security Software Program as a Breach.\r\n\r\nSo, the trick is to avoid that much Time Passing for your 1 Light Year Trip, so you can extend your trip to a larger number of Light Years, (as there is still nothing of \"importance\" only 1 Light Year from Earth). The only way to do that is rendering your Spacecraft and everyone in it \"Non-Existent\". How do you do this? Using an Electro-Magnetic Shield that creates a \"Bubble\" around the entire ship that Phases you out of your Reality (Dimension). Thus, it will take you 1 second to Travel 1 Light year and only 1 second will have actually passed. By doing this, you have brought Space and Time back Relative to one another. Like I said earlier, you can use different Formulas of Relativity as they pertain to your Distance and your EMS Bubble to go to a different Time either in the Past or the Future. As of right now, it is very difficult to calculate the arrival at a certain Date and Time so trying to get to say May 12th, 1981 (A very important date in History for the United States that very few people actually know about it), might get you within a few years to 40 years of it. Additional Computing Formulas are not known yet to get a more specific Time Travel \"Landing Point\". And they never will, I will address that in a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas very few people on this Planet understand the concept needed for the Formulas of Relativity to Fold Space and create Interstellar Space Travel, several understand the basic concepts as well as the advanced concepts regarding the creation of an Electro-Magnetic Shielding which will Phase Time (and Light, but that\'s another whole different discussion) . The first successful test of that was documented happening in the 1940\'s and after that, it went \"Underground\" until it was perfected to a working, controllable project in 1974. The Phasing of Time was discovered by mistake as the actual Project was trying to Phase (Bend) Light to be able to \"Cloak\" an object or person. If you scour the Internet, you will find some quiet examples of things and people, mostly Military, being \"Cloaked\" that have yet to be Washed from the Internet. Another off-shoot of the project along with Phasing is the ability of the EMS to deflect Solid Projectiles and Energy Waves (Beams). The US Government is at an advanced stage in this aspect of the Project as well. There is a reason the US Govt. doesn\'t get worked up when a Nation with limited Ballistic Missiles like North Korea threatens to attack the US with Nukes tipped on Ballistic Missiles. The National Defense Program of the US is much more advanced then any other Nation and it contained 6 different Levels of Defensive Measures, I was recently told the 7th Level was activated in Test Mode, to prevent an attack from a Nation wishing to destroy the US using any sort of \"Flying\" Projectiles, including Missiles and Planes. No other Nation has any sort of an \"Energy Beam\", to worry about, in fact the US is still in the Testing Stages of a High Energy Laser (HEL). Supposedly Russia was/is working on Plasma, Laser, and Electro-magnetic weapons, but intel says they are going in the \"Wrong\" direction with all of them lol. Let\'s hope they don\'t \"Eff\" it up and create or open a Singularity on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe EMS theory was conceived back in the 1920\'s and started as a way to create an Inertial Dampening Field using Magnetic Polarities and Electricity (based upon Tesla\'s unfinished and INCORRECT Theories of Electrically Charged Particles to create an Energy Source). Throughout the years and in different Countries, you will find a series of Patents relating to these \"Theories\" from several different Companies and Scientists. (I think this is where Russia is getting their Base Information for their Weapons). But they all lead back to one man, T. (Thomas) Townsend Brown (My Mentor early in my career before he passed away). The reason I have included this part in my description is if you so choose to, you can research what I am saying about this and find that I am in fact, telling you the Truth. The only part that is \"Hidden\" from the Public, before the Project went \"Underground\", is the first successful test (back in the 40\'s), which the US Government couldn\'t hide so they turned it into an \"Urban Myth\" of sorts and re-named it, \"The Philadelphia Experiment\". They figured the more time that went by, the easier it would be to hide it as a Myth and say it really never happened, which worked perfectly for them as people associated with the Project and Tests, died off. (This is the NEEDED information that Russia DOESN\'T have that set everything in motion but went in a different direction from the Registered Patents).\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, to avoid confusion, remember that even though the phrase \"Light Year\" may sound like a Time Measurement, it isn\'t, it is a Distance Measurement and it is used like that to simplify very long numeric values. Like when you use the term \"1 Light Year\" you are actually saying 5,878,625,373,183.+++ miles, with the +++ symbols being numbers after the decimal point which are mostly irrelevant when talking about a distance of 5.87 Trillion Miles.\r\nIt also does not correlate to the \"Speed of Light\" which is approximately 186,000 miles per second. The Speed of Light is the Fastest thing that Humans are able to calculate out, but not nearly the fastest thing in our reality/dimension, just the fastest thing we can calculate.\r\n\r\nAlso remember everything I mentioned is how it relates to Earth and Humans in this Reality/Dimension. Out in the vast Galaxies of Space, many things are calculated differently as they relate or pertain to other realities/dimensions.\r\n\r\nI hope you were able to keep up with my Overly Vague but \"still able to understand\", description of how to comprehend Space and Time regarding it\'s relation to things like Time Travel (which, by the way, has been Banned from being allowed to happen for the last 21 years, that is why the \"New\" Formulas needed for \"Landing\" at a Specific and Exact Time will never be finished). You now have more basic knowledge of it than 99.99999999999999% of the people ON Planet Earth.', 5, '2023-05-02 00:50:56', 0, 19, 1);
