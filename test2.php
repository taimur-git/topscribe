$text1 = "The use of information technology is currently a more popular social phenomenon than ever before. Thus, most young people are using the Internet for different purposes which may include studies and undertaking research, but mostly for socialization (Ybarra 247). The internet has now become a big source of fun for the majority of young people, with chatting, e-mailing, sharing pictures, videos and other forms of documents and files becoming everyday activities. Nevertheless, just like in many other social situations in life, there are people who take pride in harassing, demeaning and bullying others using the information technology and electronic devices, a practice commonly referred to as cyber bullying (“Prevent Cyber bullying”). Bullying can cause frustrations on the victims, especially those who are bullied constantly, resulting in psychological trauma or even more fatal occurrences such as suicide. Thus, parents should team up with their children to explore and develop safe ways of using technology, while monitoring and controlling their children’s internet use, to protect their children against cyber bullying. The practice of receiving mean messages, threatening texts, hurtful posts or even negative and damaging rumors is something that is happening with teens and adolescents every single day globally. It is no longer unusual for teens to find sexually explicit and obscene photographs of them or their friends on the internet, even without knowing how pictures ended up there. According to bullyingstatistics.org, 50 of adolescents and teens have experienced cyber bullying, and equally 50 of the teens and adolescents have been involved in cyber bullying (bullyingstatistics.org). Additionally, one in every three adolescents has received threatening messages either through the Internet or over the phone, while 25 of teens have experienced repetitive cyber bullying (bullyingstatistics.org). Consequently, according to statistics from the meganmeierfoundation.org, 2.2 million school children reported having experienced cyber bullying in the USA in 2011 (“Bullying, Cyber bullying & Suicide Statistics”). Most worrying though, is the fact that 38 of frequent bullied-victims in 2013 reported having suicidal thoughts, which sends a shock down the spine, considering that suicide has been identified as the third major cause of death for young people aged between 15 and 24 years (“Bullying, Cyber bullying & Suicide Statistics”). While the connection between cyber bullying and suicidal thoughts for 38 of the people who have been bullied repetitively can seem to be farfetched, there is no doubt that evidence lies everywhere that cyber bullying is a killer behavior. Alexis Pilkington, a well known and celebrated athlete at her prime age of career committed suicide in her bedroom, following a streak of cyber bullying messages, thus ending her promising life on March 21, 2010 (Long and Gross, n.p.). Why is cyber bulling such a big issue if one may ask? Cyber bullying has the same effects as physical bullying; only that cyber bullying is worse, since there is no running away (Ybarra, 251). It would be easier to escape from physical confrontation, but the psychological trauma arising from cyber bullying is devastating. This is because; the internet is all over, and if an individual being cyber-bullied decided not to access the internet anymore, his/her friends or alternatively enemies, will still make the torture continue. Simply put therefore, cyber bullying can frustrate a victim to death, since there are just very few options of running away from it once it has started (Ybarra, 251). The major problem is that the victim may at times turn out to be the aggressor in an attempt to defend against the cyber bullies, and this can go on until cows come home. However, one thing is certain; psychological trauma, mental illnesses or at worst suicidal thoughts, are not farfetched occurrences on cyber bullying victims. There is no doubt therefore, that many organizations, both online and on-location have come up to help address the vice of cyber bullying. In every major city or town, every social media site and every community organization running out there, someone is doing something about cyber bullying. Campaigns have been launched on the online platforms and even in the mainstream media through print messages warning against the evil of cyber bullying, while others are advertising professional help for the victims of cyber bullying. The setback associated with online and on-location campaigns against cyber bullying is that they target helping the victims of cyber bullying, and not so much on preventing potential victims from falling into the trap (bullyingstatistics.org). The government on its side is enacting, defining and redefining laws and statutes that can prosecute the perpetrators of cyber bullying once they have been unlucky to be nabbed by the hand of the law. Nevertheless, even with appropriate laws in place, with the anonymity option that cyber bullies mostly apply, finding them into the drag net is something that resilience will reward. Simply put therefore, the society is trying the most viable options at hand, but the options never prove to be adequate for the daunting task of bringing down cyber bullying (Long and Gross, n.p.). Therefore, the best and only solution to cyber bullying is this one; child-parent partnership to exploring and adapting safe ways of using the internet. Culture builds people or people build culture. Either way, culture has an influence on the way of life of a people. Thus, building the culture of responsible use of the internet and the social media platforms is the most fool proof method of addressing cyber bullying (“Prevent Cyber bullying”.). However, building such a culture cannot be that simple. The internet has temptations. But, even with the temptations, a prepared and warned teen or adolescent is better in handling the temptation than the unprepared and the clueless one. In this respect, parents can build a culture of responsible internet use through partnering with their children, not in prohibiting them from the social media and internet use, but letting them understand fully the magnitude of the danger posed by irresponsible use of the internet and the other technology tools available to them (“Prevent Cyber bullying”). Parents can sit down and discuss with their children about the internet and its applications. Parents should know what their children are doing online by carefully monitoring every of their online interaction whenever possible. Through the child-parent partnership, parents should set the rule of internet and other technology tools used by their children (“Prevent Cyber bullying”). With the knowledge of how the children are using the internet and the rules of its use in place, parents should enforce the rules with a firm hand, but encourage and reward responsible use with an equally open and embracing hand. Parents should become indirect partners to what their children do online. Monitor whatever they do through secretly installed monitoring and control software (“Prevent Cyber bullying”). Parents should borrow and use their children’s devices for simple and routine surveillance. Parent can recommend a responsible adult to follow their children on their social media websites and pages, and simply evaluate their activities. Parents should make their children’s social media and internets use their job to monitor and control. There are still chances that critics will counter this solution by holding that parents cannot stalk their children forever, while also holding that it is unethical to stalk their children’s internet and social media interactions anyway. The position for this argument however, is that monitoring and control can continue until the age of responsibility is attained, where it may become tricky for parents to continue monitoring and controlling their children. However, by then, their children will have developed a culture of caution, if not that of desisting from potentially harmful internet and social media interactions (Ybarra, 255). This way, a win-win situation will have been created by averting the chances of cyber bullies attacking such children, while also protecting against such children turning out to be cyber-bullies. If every parent would do that, then, only the runaway dissidents would be conducting the cyber bullying business, and even then, they would be fewer for the hand of law to target effectively.";
$text2 = "Overpopulation is defined “a country or region that has too many people and is therefore not capable of achieving or maintaining a suitable standard of living” (Pitzl 168). This implies that overpopulation is just about a geographical area that has too many people and limited resources to take care of the numbers of people within it. Another definition of overpopulation is that it is “the condition of having a population as dense as to cause environmental deterioration and impaired quality of life or a population crash” (Gonzalez 117). These two definitions of overpopulation seem to have some differences as well as some commonalities. First of all, both definitions are based on the fact that overpopulation is based on the fact that there might be too many people as opposed to resources in a given area. This implies that overpopulation occurs when there are more people in relation to the resources available to them for their survival and livelihoods. On the other hand, the two writers are not in agreement about the scope of globalization. Whilst Pitzl defines globalization in terms of countries or geographical regions, Gonzalez views it as a global matter which has an impact on the natural environment. This means that the first definition localizes the idea of overpopulation whilst the second generation looks at it as a global problem or issue. # Reasons why Overpopulation is a Global Issue In this world, resources and the natural environment are shared. Instead of having a limited access to natural resources, most resources in the natural environment transcend natural borders. Hence, it can be argued that if there is excessive pressure on the natural resources of a given nation, it would affect users of other nations and make it a global matter or issue. Examining overpopulation critically, it is conclusive that it leads to major problems which are a a direct consequence of having too many people using the same natural resources. This often results in pressure over natural resources, pollution, congestion, unorganized development amongst others. Nagel and Guinness identify that overpopulation can be defined in terms of having a population that is above the normal level that a nation or community can hold (111). The standard level of population that a community’s resources can support is known as the optimum population (Nagel and Guinness 111). However, when the population goes above the optimum population, there is an increasing pressure on resources and the living standards of the community would begin to decline. Hence, there would be the non-sustainable use of natural resources, and the over-use of elements of the natural environment. This leads to pressure not only on local resources but on the global ecological balance. This is because when natural resources are put to a use that is beyond the normal, there would be some implications for other resources outside the nation or community. Over population causes nations around the world to get concerns. This is because population leads to migration. And if there is migration, nations with optimal populations are also affected and they would have to find ways and means of reducing the flow of migrants into their countries. For example, in the case of China which shares a long border with Russia, there is a major threat to the Russian economy and Russian natural resources if the population of China moves further up. This is because when China’s population grows, the pressure on Chinese resources would be so high that a section of the Chinese community would have to leave the country in order to find other resources to survive on. This means that Russia would be affected by the problem of China and they would have major problems. Thus, the concern of population growth beyond the optimum is not the concern of only one country but of the global community. Two elements of overpopulation, which are climate change and the pollution of waterbodies are directly global and can only be dealt with through global means. Since overpopulation causes pressure on natural resources, the growth of populations would cause an increase in the standard of living amongst people in a given geographical area. Due to this, there is the need for more production to be done and this would potentially cause higher carbon emissions which can lead to global warming and worsen the current condition of the ozone layer. Also, the growth in population often leads to the destruction of waterbodies and rainforests around the world which adds to the reduction in the health of people around the world. This is a universal problem and hence, causes all the people of the world to go through some kind of hardships irrespective of whether they have controlled their populations or not. Thus for example, if the population in India is extremely high and it causes industries to give of high emissions and the population of Sweden is low, the influence of the Indian emissions would cause the whole world, including the people of Sweden to suffer from the high levels of emissions. This is because those problems are universal, rather than local. # Controlling Global Overpopulation Overpopulation is a serious matter. It deserves to be dealt with through a very serious and integrated approach. There are two popular approaches to dealing with environmental challenges relating to overpopulation. They are population control and environmental responsiveness (McKinney et al 48). ## Population Control Every nation can control its population if the government has a population policy. A population policy “encompasses all of the measures explicitly or implicitly taken by a government aimed at influencing population size, growth, distribution or composition” (Nagel and Guinness 114). This means that governments would make a conscious effort to define the population control targets over a given period of time to ensure that they maintain a stable and manageable population throughout the period. There are many approaches go this. This include family planning programs which set the target and number of children that a family could have (Kendall 48). An example is China where every family is forced to have just one child and not more than that. Also, there are some social systems that can be promoted in a nation to prevent the rapid growth in population. This include fecundity which include the use of policies to define the ability to have intercourse, the ability to conceive and the ability to carry pregnancies. These can be controlled by social and cultural norms as well as laws. And hence, they can be varied to help to meet the targets of the people in charge. Also, the formation and dissolution of unions can be controlled by the state to ensure that it is in sync with the population policy. Finally, birth control can be enhanced through the population policy system to enable the nation to meet its population policy targets. Due to the global nature of the overpopulation issue, population control is now a matter of global concern rather than national concern. Many developing nations now get support and guidance from richer nations to carry out their population control programs (Smith 92). There are global for a through which population matters are discussed and encouraged to get different governments to support and enhance population control. ## Environmental Responsibility Although overpopulation often causes pressure on natural resources, McKinney et al (31) argue that if there are responsible methods and means of using natural resources, the pressure is not likely to be felt. This is because where there is a structured and efficient method of dealing with the natural environment, then the environment is not likely to suffer from the effects of usage. Hence, the nations around the world are being encouraged to come up with environmental policies concerning pollution and carbon emissions amongst others. If this is done, then it can be seen that the effects of overpopulation would be controlled to a high degree. Also, in the case where technology is improved and research is conducted into producing better and more meaningful methods and systems of using the natural environment, the effects of population growth on the extraction of natural resources would be reduced and this would make the world a better place to live in. # Conclusion Overpopulation is a global issue because many natural resources transcend national boundaries. Resources like the climate and waterbodies go beyond borders. Hence, if population grows beyond normal, these resources would be affected on a global level rather than national level. Also, there is the chance for migration amongst people in the world. Hence, overpopulation in one part of the world leads to migration which causes resources in other nations to come under pressure as well. In order to deal with overpopulation on the global level, there is the need for national population policies. This must be bolstered by a global campaign for the promotion of population control and population checks. Also, responsible usage of natural resources helps in the protection of the natural environment in periods of high population growth. ";
$text ="Police are law enforcers of the nation, mandated with authority to manage community peace and security. As enforcers of laws, they underwent substantive education on security management and crime prevention strategies. Laid with high expectations from constituents, they are expected to perform their roles and mandates professionally and in observance to international humanitarian standards. However, empirical evidences showed otherwise as emerging abuses and police brutality are mounted by civilian communities. This essay will explicate police brutality in United States and delve into records of frequency, severity and ramification of police brutality exacted against civilians. # Brutality Police brutality is one of those alarming human rights violations done by person of authorities against civilians who are possible suspects or those already serving their sentences as adjudged criminals. Roberts (2011) pointed that in youtube alone, an e-site containing video records, produced about 497,000 results when “police brutality” is subjected into the search engine. Roberts (2011) described that these videos either depict beaten women, kids and the aged or violent and bloody exaction of testimonies from unwilling suspects. Some testimonies of victims who were able to undergo sad ordeal revealed electrocution; suffocation, psychological torment or threat; emotional shocks; direct physical assault, and the like done by police with psychopatic and sociopath tendencies. Skolnick and Fyfe (1993) explicated that police brutality brought along with it such dehumanizing intent by treating the target with such concealed venality and such degrading impact of violent torture. Roberts (2011) attributed this inhuman way of managing suspects, civilians and victims to militarist treatment as abuse of power. Those who are involved in police brutality tactics are characterized with such nastiness as they were trained to view the public, the people whom they ought to secure, as their enemy. To some extent, some police officers have made policing activity leveled beyond preservation of order into cyclical patterns of injustice as commission of human rights. Often logged without witnesses to corroborate the conduct of brutalities, Bandes (1999) noted that authorities would just label this as an incident which is either isolated, systemic, or part of a larger pattern to suppress a movement. Bandes (1999) explicated that police brutality are often portrayed by court as something anecdotal, fragmented and isolated from institutional pattern (p. 1275) reinforced by causes that could be political, social, psychological and cultural (Bandes, 1999, p. 2). Experts opined that victims of police brutality would have difficulty expressing such unfair victimization because complaints about it are discouraged due to dearth of evidences, lack of corroborative testimonies, records are expunged, and police records are purposively made inaccessible. Victims are also doubly confronted with difficulty in baring experiences out of restrictive evidentiary rulings, of judicial insensitivity to police perjury, of the law of omerta or total silence, of assailant’s immunity from punitive actions (Bandes, 1999, p. 7). Thus, there is perceived failure to correct endemic system of police lawlessness and adherence to violence, often directed to powerless and marginalized members of specific communities. Police brutality is not simply a violent act. More often, these are kinds of security managers who are in collaboration with groups and decision-makers who lacked respect to procedures that are legally provided. The prevalence of these cases on police brutality simply depict the need to address the problem not only at the institutional level but must be comprehensively rectified by in-depth investigation; of brutality cases demystification, and strict enforcement of the administrative laws to hasten the professionalization of police forces. Empirical studies based on selected cases further showed that police brutalities aren’t investigated with expediency or effectiveness, and unless the case is focused with media mileage, no administrative actions are instituted by executive authorities. # King Case The case of Rodney Glen King is a classic and most prominent example of police brutality. King, a divorcee with kids, was violently harmed and beaten by police enforcers of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) sometime in 1991 after he was caught by authorities robbing a store and have gravely threatened and lambasted the storeowner with an iron bar (Cannon, 1999). King was beaten by police badly and such incident was captured by media workers who magnified it to public eyes, and subsequently caused dissension amongst black community—people who have viewed the incident as glaring proof of racial prejudice and discrimination (Cannon, 1999). Police were subjected in a court trial but whose acquittal resulted to riots at LA in 1992. Civil suits were later charged against the enforcers which jailed two officers while two others were acquitted (Cannon, 1999). In a subsequent case, King and his two other companies were arrested by police officers due to over speeding at a highway and driving his car with alcohol’s influence (Cannon, 1999). Albeit police warning, King ignored them. He also made some resistance while authorities were about to handcuff him. Police used taser to subdue him but was later prompted to beat him with56 batons blows which caused him 11 skull fractures and brain damage, broken joints, bones and teeth. Medical test further proved that King was using marijuana. He was likewise severely ridiculed by enforcers while at such state (Cannon, 1999). Out of this incident, LA lawyers sued the police officers for excessive use of violent force to King and of administrative negligence due to his inability of the supervisor to order the stoppage of further assaults to King (Cannon, 1999). The trial orbited with procedural sensitivities until the jury of Ventura Country decided for the acquittal of accused policemen (Cannon, 1999). The decision was however unacceptable for US president and other executives citing that King is a victim of police brutality (Cannon, 1999). The impact of such decision and resulted to violence rooted by blackmen-sponsored riots in LA which killed a number of persons, wounded thousands, damaged the national economy and incurred financial losses (Cannon, 1999). After he recovered, King appealed for peace on television and the Department of Justice of United States revived the investigation. The case resulted to the imprisonment of Laurence Powell and Sergeant Satcey Koon (Cannon, 1999). Wind and Briseno were acquitted. King was indemnified with $3.8 million from said civil suit (Cannon, 1999). # Conclusion The case of King did not end there. It happened with many others. Indeed, the cited cases remind government authorities to further improve and professionalize policemen of their duties in managing peace and order. On the other hand, there is also a need for civilian populace to exercise their rights with sobriety, to be lawful and to act with propriety. People ought to realize that peace and order, isn’t the sole responsibility of police authorities. It is likewise the role of the civilian community to maintain community peace, although they must also reassert their constitutional rights in case they become object of police brutality and other relate or form of human rights violations. Meanwhile, stakeholders of peace and justice should maintain their vigilance to uphold human rights at all times and to act with moral uprightness.";
